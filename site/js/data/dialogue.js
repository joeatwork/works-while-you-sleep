'Tell me the truth about what?',
'You weren\'t expected, Olivia. Alexandra and I are having a private  conversation.',
'I heard my name, Alan.',
'I repeat, Alexandra and I are having a private conversation.',
'Alan, really, is that any way to speak to your bride? I mean,  surely Olivia has a right to join in our little chat.',
'Oh, excuse me a second, I have to talk to Phillip.',
'Yeah, bye. Hey.',
'Hi.',
'I have left you about a dozen messages. Don\'t you ever check  your... I haven\'t been by the office, Ross, I\'m sorry, I got a lot going  on right now, what\'s up?',
'What? Why?',
'They suspect insider trading.',
'That\'s insane.',
'At the moment, it\'s only a preliminary investigation.',
'I don\'t care. You know what? Don\'t worry about it. Whoever called  you, have them call and deal with Spauldings in-house counsel, they\'ll  take care of it.',
'No, they won\'t. The S.E.C. Called me because I\'m the attorney taking  care of your personal finances.',
'They\'re investigating my personal finances? Did you happen to  mention to them the hit that I have taken in the market lately? Are they  out of their minds?',
'I told them that their investigation was totally without merit. And  you know, for the life of me, I can\'t figure out how this was brought  about.',
'Yeah, I wonder.',
'Hey, yourself. Cassie Winslow. Hotel entrepreneur, super-mom,  message taker extraordinaire.',
'That\'s good news.',
'Yeah.',
'Well, because the way that you just said that, it kind of sounded  like you were disappointed.',
'Danny, don\'t.',
'Don\'t what? What? Don\'t you feel like there\'s still something in  between us.',
'I know that there is, okay? But there\'s a lot of things between  us, and most of them are just in the way.',
'Michelle, look, I hate the fact that I wasn\'t here last night to  stop Carmen, but it\'s not going to happen anymore. It\'s over.',
'How do we know that, Danny? She tried to kill me again last  night. She went after our little boy, our baby.',
'Michelle, my mother is going to spend the rest of her, life, either  in a coma or in prison. Why are you doing this? Don\'t let her keep us  apart any longer.',
'It\'s not just her, it\'s everything, Danny. Everything has  changed.',
'I still think this is about Bill.',
'What? No, no. Bill has nothing to do with us.',
'I\'m sorry, I don\'t believe you.',
'It\'s not Bill, and it\'s not Carmen, Danny. It\'s us. We\'re  breaking apart because of us. Don\'t look at me like that. Say something.',
'What do you want me to say? I think you\'ve just said it. ',
'We were the ones who tore us apart, Danny. We did it. You told  me to move on. And I...',
'Oh, don\'t even talk to me about your big plans, when I wasn\'t  included in them in the first place.',
'What are you talking about? Michelle, you\'re all I ever thought  about. Everything I did, I did for you.',
'Those things are over now. We can work through this. I believe we  can.',
'Work, that\'s just it. It shouldn\'t be so much work.',
'Call me crazy, but the guy takes a bullet, you secretly nurse him  back to health, that kind of thing usually makes people a little close.',
'Okay, hey. You know, I\'m just calling it like I see it, honey.',
'Hey.',
'Hi, darling.',
'We interrupting anything?',
'No, just Blake\'s imagination in overdrive.',
'Not a first.',
'Well, it\'s very difficult to shift gears, you know, when you\'re a  radio talk show host for the lovelorn, but I really do need to get down to  business.',
'Business?',
'Mm-hmm. I want to rent a ballroom.',
'Oh. Okay. For what kind of event?',
'It\'s a party. No, actually, make that a gala.',
'Okay, gala, got it.',
'Can the beacon handle the catering?',
'Yeah, piece of cake. Hey. ',
'Ooh, yeah, I\'m going to need that, too. Big, white, one, lots of  tiers, little man, little woman on top.',
'A wedding cake? Are you and Ross...',
'...Are getting hitched. Hey, but I don\'t want you taking this gig  catering if it\'s going to take you away from your very important co-maid  of honor duties.',
'Oh, I\'m so happy for you, this is great.',
'Hey, you know what? I don\'t want to hold you up here, don\'t worry  about the S.E.C. Thing, I\'ll take care of it.',
'Phillip, you know the business climate these days. They find a call  in your phone logs, then a few days later there\'s a stock sale, and off  they go.',
'Ross, I don\'t really think this is about looking for  coincidences; I think there\'s something else going on.',
'Do you know who\'s behind this?',
'I think it may be my father.',
'Why would Alan do this?',
'It\'s complicated.',
'All right. Is there anything I can do?',
'No. But there\'s something I can do. I\'ll keep you posted, thanks.',
'Well, what do you say, Alan, can Olivia come in and play?',
'Well, Alexandra, I guess we\'ll have to put that other matter to  rest.',
'Oh, well, we can wake it up later.',
'I\'m sure you\'d like that, wouldn\'t you? You wanted something?',
'I want to know why you\'re doing this to me.',
'Ah, the pre-nup.',
'Yes, the pre-nup.',
'What\'s the matter, did I forget to cross the \"T\'s\" and dot the  \"I\'s.\"',
'Don\'t patronize me, Alan. You have half the beacon and whatever  else I agreed to when I signed my life away to you.',
'I messed up! Okay? I\'ve admitted it, I\'ve apologized to you.  You\'re like a dog with a bone, you won\'t let this go.',
'Maybe it\'s because I can\'t get the image of you and Phillip running  in my head like a videotape. Kind of puts a new spin on the phrase \"may  the best man win.\"',
'I didn\'t tell you about the tape because I\'d already put the whole  situation behind me. Forgive me for trying to spare your feelings.',
'Yes, well, actions speak louder than words.',
'You make me sound as if I\'m out for revenge, Olivia. Well, I\'m not.',
'So enforcing the pre- nup, that\'s what? A prelude to a divorce.',
'That\'s not what I want, either.',
'So this is just a not-so-subtle reminder that I hurt you. Oh,  Alan, trust me, I know I did.',
'Well, you\'re angry, and you\'re entitled, but I love you, and I  just want a chance to prove to you how much to be your wife, that\'s all I  want.',
'That\'s what I want, too.',
'Alan, Alan, I promise you I won\'t let anything come between us  ever again.',
'You\'re sure?',
'It is not your fault. He has been competing with me and fighting  with me.',
'You can\'t do that. Listen to me, because whatever happens between  us. I could not live with myself if I caused a rift between you and your  son.',
'So much for dead and buried.',
'Alan, please. Phillip has bent over backwards.',
'I don\'t want to hear Phillip\'s name again! If he doesn\'t mean that  much to you, why do you keep defending him?',
'Nice night, huh?',
'Yeah, no kidding. You see the big dipper right up there? It\'s the  one right there.',
'Yeah.',
'Yeah. And right above it is the north star.',
'It\'s amazing the different stuff you know about. You always surprise  me.',
'So what are you doing out here all alone? Slow night in there?',
'Oh, that\'s scary.',
'It sounds like your basic stress dream. You know, like showing up for  class with no clothes on.',
'I don\'t know. I just think it\'s just more like, this place is  really getting to me, you know. I need some kind of change.',
'Enter Ben Reade, ready to take you away from all of this. Are you  game?',
'Okay, so, have you picked the colors yet, because I want the  caterers to coordinate the colors with the tablecloth.',
'Oh, fabulous. You know what? I want the musicians to match, too.',
'Okay. Well, so far we got the quartet for the cocktail hour, brass  for the processional, and the strings for the reception.',
'Mm-hmm.',
'Three different bands?',
'Yeah, should I get rid of the fourth?',
'Have you told Harley yet?',
'I was just about to make the next call.',
'Ah, she\'s going to be so mad that I know first. ( Laughter )',
'You know, I know you and Blake were taking the plunge, I just didn\'t  know there was going to be such a splash.',
'Oh, ed, nothing but the best for this young lady.',
'Ah, that\'s right. We\'re going to have a wedding that goes down in  the Springfield record book.',
'Well, you need to set the date so we can start making history.',
'Mrs. Winslow, there\'s a delivery you need to sign for.',
'Okay, I\'ll be right there. I have to run. I am so happy for you  guys. I am.',
'So what do you say? A round of drinks for everybody, before we dive  into the planning?',
'Yes, indeed. Ed and I will be your waiters.',
'Ridiculous? It was brilliant. And I couldn\'t have done it without  you.',
'Oh, please, don\'t remind me.',
'Plus, it also stirred a few sparks between you and Holly, and  there\'s nothing lame about that, Edward.',
'Well, we\'re taking it slow. We have a lot of things to think about.',
'Awful lot of history there.',
'And that turned into the ballroom at the beacon with all of  Springfield and their cousins.',
'Get the drinks.',
'Michelle, you got to give us the chance that we deserve. This time  it\'s going to be different.',
'Yeah, we have, but I\'m still the man that you fell in love with.  You still know me.',
'Not anymore, Danny. I don\'t think that you do, either.',
'What does that mean?',
'What is to figure out? What, what, what? Tell me.',
'Yeah, please don\'t say that.',
'I don\'t... I don\'t understand where this is coming from. Remember  the other night when we talked?',
'I know, the other night when we talked, I wanted to believe that  new year\'s Eve could be a new start for us.',
'Right.',
'I wanted to believe that so badly because I love you so much.  And how many new starts do we need before we realized that  maybe we should  just finish?',
'I know you and I know my son. He has been competing and fighting  with me most of his life.',
'Alan, what does that make me, some kind of prize? I\'m a trophy  wife to you?',
'You know, he should\'ve thought about that-- his loyalty and his love  for me-- before he tried to seduce you in the elevator.',
'But listen to me, he would do anything for you, don\'t you  understand that? He doesn\'t deserve... What did you do?',
'I don\'t know what you\'re talking about.',
'What did you do? You invoked the pre-nup to remind me how much I  hurt you, you blame him more than me, what did you do to remind him?',
'I\'ve done nothing.',
'Stop it! You say you know Phillip and me, well, I know you. Prove  it to me. Do it! Call off your dogs.',
'To Ross and Blake.',
'And to new beginnings.',
'A bash with a splash.',
'You know something, I think this town could use a party that could  knock its collective socks off.',
'Ooh, a sock-hop, there\'s an idea.',
'You\'re not serious.',
'No, mother, I\'m not serious. This is going to be a very classy  affair.',
'Well, there goes my idea for a circus wedding. Ed, keep the monkeys,  but cancel the trapeze people.',
'The beacon has so much character. We just need to glam up and show  up.',
'Black tie.',
'No, white tie.',
'Like I said, white tie.',
'Ooh, the ballroom. I need to look at the ballroom, because if we\'re  going to have a couple hundred people, we have to get very creative with  the seating.',
'Yes, no time like the present, shall we? Ed, Holly?',
'No, you two, go ahead. Go ahead.',
'I\'d rather be surprised.',
'We\'ll be back.',
'Too much.',
'They do seem happy.',
'Never happier. I\'m just amazed how well they\'re handling all this  planning.',
'Actually I\'m amazed by all of it. But then I\'ve been away for a long  time, so.',
'Well, trust it, there will be compromises.',
'Ah, well, that\'s marriage for you.',
'Ain\'t that the truth.',
'I was...',
'You know, I thought.',
'Go ahead.',
'No, no, please. You go first.',
'No, wait. Ross said that.',
'Yeah, more or less. Why?',
'Blake just said exactly the same thing.',
'What, she thinks that Ross wants the big wedding? Come on, he\'d be  just as happy eloping.',
'So would she.',
'So much for their ideal wedding.',
'Well, unless we say something, this is going to turn into their  worst nightmare.',
'I don\'t know what to do. I mean, I\'ve spent all this time trying to  get back to you. What am I supposed to do now? What do you want me to do?',
'I need you to walk away.',
'That\'s what you really want.',
'It\'s what I need.',
'I love you. I love our son.',
'I love you, too. But I\'m spent. I just need some space.',
'Space.',
'I need... I need something solid to build my life around. It\'s  the only thing that we never had. It\'s the only thing that I know that I  need right now.',
'You know I\'d do anything for you. You\'re asking me to do the one  thing that I can\'t do. Walk away from you?',
'No, you can, Danny, you\'re strong.',
'Not like you.',
'I don\'t feel very strong right now.',
'You are. You always have been.',
'Please don\'t. Please. I love you too much to tell you no. I need  you to go.',
'Okay. I love you, Michelle.',
'I love you, too.',
'I can\'t believe it. Blake, I thought you wanted a wedding to end all  weddings.',
'Only because that\'s what I thought you wanted.',
'But now you know, so now you can plan the wedding you want.',
'Mom, you make it sound like this is no big deal. This is huge.',
'Honey, don\'t make such a big thing out of it.',
'Well, you still are wanting the same thing, you know, with the  wedding. It\'s just, you know, before you were wanting the wrong same  thing.',
'I agree with Blake.',
'You do?',
'I know, Ross, I think we need to really work on this.',
'Can you imagine what would\'ve happened if we were to spend a fortune  on this mega wedding, and then we realized that we both hated it? It  would\'ve been...',
'A fiasco. And the kids.',
'And their college fund.',
'We would\'ve blown the entire thing just because we were trying to  put on this pricey dog and pony show.',
'Guys, guys, you\'re finishing each other\'s thoughts, each other\'s  sentences, and you\'re worried about not being on the same page.',
'Do you think we should see somebody?',
'I think we need to open up the lines of communication.',
'I do, too. Felicia?',
'Well, I don\'t like to mix friendship with therapy.',
'Holly Reade, you\'re a wise woman.',
'Oh. Listen, you two, go. Start all over, marriage 101.',
'Oh, the ballroom. Ooh, we have to cancel the ballroom, because  Cassie just may go ahead and order the carpets to match the flowers.',
'You didn\'t ask her to buy new carpets, did you? Let\'s go find  Cassie. Ed, Holly, thank you very much.',
'Mm-hmm.',
'Disaster averted.',
'Wow. I\'ll say. You know, I just have to second the stuff that Ross  said about you being a really very wise woman.',
'Did he said very wise?',
'No, he didn\'t say very... I\'m saying very wise. The whole thing about  listen and compromise and we\'re walking on eggshells.',
'Well, I have to confess that the advice I gave them I frequently  give myself when I\'m with you.',
'It\'s good advice.',
'Well.',
'Wow, a ski trip, that sounds amazing.',
'Are you kidding me, it will be amazing. I\'m thinking two, maybe three  nights away. All right, no family, no restaurant, hopefully no chicken  salad dreams.',
'No, imagine that.',
'Days on the slopes, nights by the fireplace.',
'Oh, you do not have to convince me. There\'s really only one  problem I can think of.',
'Oh, your dad.',
'No. God, no, I haven\'t even thought that far ahead yet. Please,  let me dream a little, okay. The one problem being I\'ve never skied before  in my entire life. ',
'So?',
'So you don\'t have any money.',
'You mean, you\'re not going to pay for me?',
'( Goofy laugh )',
'Just kidding, come on. I can do this, Marina, it\'s only one weekend.',
'No, I\'m not going to start living like I\'m broke just because...',
'But you are. You\'re broke, and you have to face it.',
'Well, if you\'re going, I\'m going.',
'I\'m interrupting something.',
'Very perceptive, son.',
'I could come back.',
'No, you need to hear this.',
'I\'ll decide if he needs to hear this or not, Olivia.',
'He doesn\'t believe me. He\'s not listening to me. He thinks there\'s  something going on between the two of us, and he wants to pin the whole  thing on you.',
'Oh, really? Is that so.',
'It doesn\'t just end with the pre-nup. He\'s coming after you. You  have to be careful.',
'Oh, Olivia, don\'t worry. I know how to handle my father.',
'I command you to...',
'I heard shouting.',
'Whoa, girl steps out to powder her nose, and misses all the  fun. Well, do fill me in, Alan. What is it, dear? Struck speechless?',
'Danny. I think this belongs to you.',
'What\'s this?',
'It\'s your Bill. I\'m sure you\'re moving out, right?',
'Well...',
'I talked to Tony, he said that... He said you were with Michelle.',
'I\'m sorry. I just assumed that you and Michelle, you guys...',
'Yeah, well, so did I. So did I.',
'You know what? It\'s probably new, maybe it\'s too soon, but you  can\'t give up. You know, you can\'t give up, Danny.',
'No, I\'m not planning on it. I don\'t know, Cassie, sometimes it  might be best to just walk away.',
'Thank you. You didn\'t have to do that, but thank you.',
'Yes, I did.',
'I\'m not sure that now is the right time, you have a lot on you  right now. You don\'t need to be making things harder for yourself.',
'( Groans )',
'Alan, will you stop it? Just stop it. You can only cry wolf so  many times, my dear brother, and then may I remind you how the story ends.',
'( Groans )',
'No ice.',
'I\'m sorry!  ',
'Oh, no -- ',
'What happened?  I\'m sorry.  ',
'Oh, the cereal -- it was supposed to -- ',
'Don\'t worry, don\'t worry.  I\'ll clean it up.  All right?  ',
'Okay.  ',
'I just wanted  to tell you that -- the baby\'s not going to be a problem anymore.  ',
'You finally told Chris he\'s the father?  ',
'I told Chris everything he needs to know.  ',
'Well, I won\'t be needing this anymore.  ',
'Luce, wow.  This might sound weird.  I was just thinking about you.  ',
'How\'ve you been?  ',
'Good.  Been around, you know.  I\'ve actually been meaning to talk to you -- but I had to do some things, first.  Make sure, you know?  ',
'What kinda things?  ',
'Got a spot right in front.  How\'s it going, Aaron?  ',
'Good.  ',
'We have study hall this morning at school.  So we just came by to grab some muffins. ',
'Okay, well, happy studying.  ',
'You\'re supposed to be in hiding.  And do not smoke in my house.  ',
'You worried maybe I\'ll die on you?  ',
'One more puff, and make it terminal.  ',
'You making breakfast?  I like my eggs over easy.  ',
'Breakfast is over.  ',
'You better watch yourself, Montgomery.   You don\'t treat me right -- ',
'Or what?!  You\'ll tell Rosanna about Cabot\'s adoption?  ',
'So like I said -- eggs over easy, with sausage.  Patties, not links.  ',
'You can\'t be seen, remember?  ',
'The housekeeper is doing the laundry, and nobody else is home.  I\'ll meet you in the Kitchen. ',
'Okay, Annabelle, time for you to go.  ',
'This is your plane ticket to New York -- your boarding pass on a cruise ship to Singapore.  ',
'I\'ll need a passport.  Lucinda Walsh?  ',
'The resemblance is uncanny.  And besides, I\'ve always wanted to send her to the other side of the world.  This is probably as close as I will be able to get.  ',
'What about some do-re-mi?  ',
'Money?  ',
'Cough it up.  ',
'Control your urges, woman.  Here, this should suffice.  If it doesn\'t, sell a lung.  ',
'That\'s my daughter.  Come on.  Hide -- back here, back here. ',
'What about my cab?  ',
'He will wait.  ',
'Aw, c\'mon!  ',
'Hi, daddy.  ',
'Hi, sweetness.  Clark!  I thought you had school today.  ',
'We do.  We have study hall.  I just came by to pick up my notes.  ',
'Ah.  ',
'Daddy, have -- ',
'What?  ',
'Have you been smoking?  ',
'No!  No, no.  Somebody was here, and they lit up before I could stop them.  ',
'Oh, yeah, and did you order a cab?  There was one outside.  ',
'Yeah, I needed a cab today.  ',
'Well, don\'t let us keep you. ',
'Right.  ',
'Craig, where are you?  I\'m out of the hospital, and I need that money.  All right?  I\'m at Lily\'s place now, so if you happen to be in the neighborhood?  ',
'Yes?  ',
'Hi.  ',
'Hi.  ',
'Is Lily home?  ',
'No, Lily\'s in court, at Barbara Ryan\'s hearing.  ',
'Oh, right.  I\'m having a little trouble getting into Rosie\'s place.  So I was hoping she could open it up for me.  ',
'Well, you can\'t get in because Holden changed the locks.  ',
'Mitzi, maybe I didn\'t make myself clear.  Holden changed the locks because of you.  ',
'As soon as Barbara\'s confession is admitted into the record, I\'m gonna follow up on having those charges dropped against you.  ',
'It\'s still not too late to have your confession thrown out.  Given your history, I can make a case for mental instability.  ',
'I don\'t want my confession thrown out.  I just want you to get the lightest sentence possible.  ',
'All right, it\'s your money.  ',
'Do you think that the evidence that you have is gonna put Barbara\'s confession in doubt?  ',
'Absolutely.  ',
'Your honor, May I approach? ',
'What\'s he doing?  ',
'I\'m not sure.  ',
'Here we go.  ',
'Based on new evidence that has just come to my attention, the state requests a stay in entering Barbara Ryan\'s plea of guilty into the record.  ',
'I am unaware of any new evidence in this case, your honor.  ',
'I was unaware of it myself, your honor.  But this evidence is critical.  ',
'And the nature of this invaluable information?  ',
'It points to a new suspect in the killing of Rose D\'Angelo.  ',
'I wasn\'t really watching where I was going.  I was kind of in a hurry to find you.  ',
'I was in a hurry to find you, too. ',
'Good morning.  ',
'Good morning.  ',
'Last night was -- ',
'I know.  ',
'It was incredible.  And I didn\'t mean to ruin things when I started talking about Simon\'s picture -- ',
'No, you didn\'t ruin anything.  You couldn\'t.  It was too perfect.  ',
'When we were together, there was just this communication.  Like this understanding.  Now I\'m ruining it by talking about it, aren\'t I?  ',
'All right.  Whatever you want.  ',
'Okay.  Okay.  Sit here.  Lay down.  Relax, and I\'ll be right back.  ',
'Ah!  \"Mike, I -- I -- \" ',
'This is great.  ',
'Alison, I\'m at the hospital.  I\'m looking for you.  I need to talk to you as soon as possible.  Call me back.  Don\'t forget, okay?  Bye.  ',
'Hey, Chris.  Ah, you wouldn\'t happen to know where ali is, would you?  ',
'Ah, no.  You\'d have to check with the nursing supervisor. ',
'Look, man, I know it\'s been tough for you.  But I didn\'t know the whole story myself.  ',
'It\'s okay, Aaron.  Forget it.  ',
'Really?  ',
'Yeah, look.  I know I didn\'t have any right to yell at alison the way that I did.  Well, you\'re her husband.  Okay, I don\'t blame you for protecting her.  ',
'Okay, what about the rest of it?  ',
'She lied to me again.  ',
'Shouldn\'t you be going?  ',
'Yeah, in a minute, sweetness.  I\'m just -- um -- this tie -- I\'m thinking about changing it.  Do you like it?  Should I change?  ',
'No, I think it\'s fine.  ',
'Yeah?  ',
'Well, I\'ll be right back.  ',
'Okay.  ',
'Lucy -- has clark ever seen the tower?  ',
'No, but I\'d love to.  ',
'Huh?  Well, how about that?  Why don\'t you give him the grand tour?  ',
'Okay.  ',
'Huh?  ',
'It\'s this way.  ',
'All right, hurry.  Get out of here before they come back.  Come on.  Let\'s go. ',
'You gonna be taking care of my situation while I\'m gone?  ',
'I am working on your situation as we speak.  By the time you get back from Singapore, your legal problems will be over.  ',
'Well, they\'d better be.  You got some vodka?  I usually need some help before I fly.  ',
'I\'m sure you do.  If you hurry, you can have a little popsky at the airport bar.  There you go.  Bad voyage!  Don\'t forget not to write.  ',
'Mitzi?  ',
'You\'re still here?  What happened to your cab?  ',
'Sure.  ',
'I love you.  Oh, and, clark -- pleasure.  ',
'Well, are you ready to go?  ',
'What\'s the hurry?  ',
'Well, we have a test in a few hours.  And we really should start studying.  ',
'So, why don\'t we study here?  Your parents are gone.  Your brother is sleeping.  We have the whole place to ourselves.  ',
'Your honor, this is absurd.  How can there be another suspect when I\'ve already confessed?  ',
'Ms.  Ryan, please sit down.  ',
'Your honor, I\'m gonna need some time to review these papers. ',
'You and me both, Mr. Newman.  Pending my review of these documents, this court is adjourned without prejudice, for 24 hours.  ',
'What do they say?  ',
'It\'s something about computer files.  ',
'I don\'t understand.  Barbara\'s free to go?  ',
'No, no.  She\'s still under arrest.  I\'m gonna find out what\'s going on here.  ',
'Mom, I don\'t understand why you\'re so unhappy.  If there\'s another suspect, that means you could get off.  ',
'If I had wanted to get off, I wouldn\'t have confessed.  ',
'I\'ll hang around in case you need me. ',
'Did you know anything about this?  ',
'Obviously, it\'s a mistake.  I poisoned Rose.  That\'s why we\'re here.  You haven\'t told will about my confession yet, have you?  ',
'I told you that I would wait until after the hearing.  I even kept him home from school today, to stop him from hearing about it from another classmate.  ',
'Good, good, good.  I want to tell him.  I want to be the one, but -- I want to speak to Lynn michaels first, so I know how to put it.  ',
'I can ask her to visit you.  ',
'Well, we\'re in recess.  Can\'t I please call?  ',
'Make it quick.  ',
'I\'d really like to sit down somewhere and gather my thoughts a little bit. ',
'Jack?  See if the judge has left his chambers.  If he has, let Barbara in there to make a call.  ',
'Thank you.  ',
'This way.  ',
'It\'s empty.  Go ahead.  ',
'So, what do you think now?  ',
'About tom\'s papers?  Well, I have to see them first.  ',
'No.  About Mitzi as the killer.  ',
'I thought you were over this.  ',
'Tom said there\'s another suspect.  It\'s Mitzi, Jack.  It\'s gotta be, and I\'m going to prove it.  Believe me, you\'ll thank me later.  ',
'Carly -- Carly!  ',
'Well, you certainly got everybody\'s attention, pussycat.  Rose would be proud of you.  I am, too.  All right, give me a call.  Call me. ',
'Thanks.  ',
'See, this is all part of her big plan.  There\'ll be confusion.  There\'ll be distractions.  And Barbara\'s gonna figure out a way to get off.  ',
'She told me she didn\'t even want to get off.  ',
'I think we just have to relax, here.  I think we have to find out what\'s in those papers first.  ',
'Making a scene is not gonna be productive.  ',
'You act like you got us beat.  Didn\'t you know we got proof now? ',
'Dusty, stay out of it.  ',
'What\'s he talking about?  Did all this come from him?  ',
'You and I need to talk.  ',
'Why?  What\'s going on here?  ',
'You two are out of your minds.  I didn\'t kill Rose, all right?!  So there\'s no way that they\'re gonna be able to prove it!  ',
'Jessica, can you tell us what\'s in those documents?  ',
'It doesn\'t matter, Rosanna.  It\'s all lies.  ',
'Oh, it\'s gonna matter, when they decide to execute you, believe me.  ',
'Oh.  ',
'Jen, will you check the judge\'s chambers?  Your mother is in there making a phone call. ',
'Yeah, yeah.  ',
'Your love was a lie.  You\'re lying right now by saying you didn\'t murder her.  ',
'Listen to me!  Barbara poisoned Rose, and now she\'s figured out a way to get away with it.  ',
'Dad, mom wasn\'t in the chambers.  I think she\'s left the building.  ',
'I\'ll be in the living room.  ',
'Uh, you know what your dad said, sweetie.  ',
'Yeah, no TV.  ',
'So why don\'t you hang out in here with me. ',
'What is he hiding from me?  ',
'Your father isn\'t hiding anything from you.  He just wants to discuss something with you later.  ',
'That\'s the same thing!  Is this about Paul?  ',
'You know what?  Why don\'t you hang out with me and help me bake the pie?  You know, it always tastes better when you make it with somebody else.  ',
'Oh, that\'s the dryer.  I\'m gonna go take care of that.  You think about it, okay?  Where did you get this?  ',
'Hey.  ',
'Did your mother give this to you?  ',
'Give it back!  ',
'No, I asked you a question, will.  ',
'Yes, she did. ',
'Well, you know the rules.  No contact with your mother unless it\'s supervised.  ',
'Those rules suck!  She loves me more than anyone!  ',
'I\'m not going to have this argument with you, will.  ',
'Yeah, sure.  That\'s all you and dad ever do is boss me around.  ',
'Will, would you get -- will, get down here?!  ',
'I need to see will.  ',
'You sure that\'s what Holden wanted?  I mean, maybe there\'s some way I can get in touch with him.  ',
'Mitzi, Holden doesn\'t want to talk to you.  And from what he\'s told me, neither do I.  So if you\'ll excuse me, I\'m sorry.  ',
'What are you doing here, Mitzi?  How come you\'re not at Rose\'s? ',
'I\'ve been officially uninvited, all right?  They changed the locks on me.  ',
'\'Cause of Paul Ryan?  ',
'Yeah.  Remember, you had me lie to Lily about Paul poisoning Rose\'s champagne.  ',
'Yeah, yeah.  You have nothing to complain about.  You were well compensated, morally and monetarily, for all your efforts.  ',
'Yeah, well, I haven\'t seen the monetary part yet.  ',
'Well, here.  This completes our transaction.  ',
'The feeling is mutual.  Just in case you were wondering, I\'m not leaving Oakdale.  ',
'Oh, why not?  ',
'I\'m using this to buy the roller palace, and I\'m gonna show Lily and you, everyone else in this bird I can take care of myself. ',
'Oh, Mitzi, the beauty business is ugly.  ',
'Well, well, isn\'t this cozy?  I should have known you two would hook up eventually.  Bottom feeding is so much more fun with company.  ',
'Okay.  This doesn\'t mean I love you any less.  ',
'I thought I heard you in here.  ',
'Hey, you\'re supposed to be in bed.  ',
'I just -- I thought we\'d be a little better off in the Kitchen.  ',
'Why?  ',
'\'Cause last night was beautiful.  I just -- I don\'t want to push things too much this morning, that\'s all.  ',
'Oh, I didn\'t think we were. ',
'Well, you\'re acting a little weird.  ',
'Okay, so you noticed.  ',
'Well, it\'s kind of hard -- you took your wedding ring off.  ',
'Yeah.  Last night.  ',
'How\'s that feel?  ',
'Naked, but not in a bad way.  ',
'Good.  I\'m glad to hear it.  ',
'Well, that\'s not the only thing you need to hear.  Oh, I want to say it, but I just -- ',
'What?  ',
'I want it to be so special.  ',
'Hey, everything you do is special.  Just spell it out.  ',
'Okay, that\'s exactly what I\'m going to do.  ',
'Well, we broke out of milltown early today, didn\'t we?  What happened?  Did the fabric softener get to you?  ',
'No.  No, actually, I\'m here to see Mitzi.  ',
'Mitzi\'s just leaving.  ',
'Aren\'t you interested in my news?  It\'s about Barbara Ryan\'s hearing.  ',
'Thanks anyway.  I\'ll read it in the newspaper.  ',
'Well, what happened at Barbara Ryan\'s hearing?  ',
'Tom hughes says there\'s another suspect.  ',
'Even after Barbara confessed?  ',
'The judge called a recess so she could go over the evidence.  But if it\'s not Barbara, who else on earth could it be?  ',
'Your husband\'s a cop.  Why don\'t you ask him?  ',
'Rosanna was at the hearing.  I think I\'ll check with her.  Ladies --',
'Hey, Craig, you know what?  I could use a ride into town.  He heard me.  ',
'The whole neighborhood heard you, Mitzi.  So what\'s with the suitcase?  ',
'I\'ve been kicked out of Rosie\'s place.  Happy?  ',
'No, but it is a start.  ',
'Great work, Hal, really.  Great work.  She should have been handcuffed the moment that she confessed.  ',
'Relax, Paul.  Barbara will be found.  ',
'Paul, wait a minute.  We need to talk about this new evidence.  ',
'You have got to be kidding.  Are we going to take this seriously?  ',
'Yes, we are.  ',
'Okay, fine.  Go ahead, tell me, what\'s it all about.  What\'s going on?  ',
'I don\'t think you want to do this here.  ',
'Why not?  I\'ve got nothing to hide.  ',
'I would strongly advise against it.  ',
'I don\'t know, jessica, maybe you should listen to your client on this one.  ',
'Yeah, I have to agree.  I\'d like to see his reaction.  ',
'Jessica, it\'s fine, really.  Go ahead. ',
'The police went through your computer.  They found several files containing information downloaded from the internet.  ',
'I\'m often on the internet.  I didn\'t know that was a crime.  ',
'These are the sites that were logged onto from your computer.  They all contain information about using methanol as a poison.  ',
'Got you, Paul.  And you ain\'t getting out of this one.  ',
'You know damn well you shouldn\'t even be -- ',
'Will, will!  I need to see you down here right now!  And I\'m very tired of you standing between me and my son!  ',
'Maybe you should have thought of that before you -- what are you doing here, anyway?  Shouldn\'t you be in court? ',
'The hearing was postponed.  ',
'Well, then why aren\'t you in jail?  ',
'I have a very good lawyer.  ',
'Yeah, well, no lawyer\'s that good, believe -- oh, my God, you escaped.  ',
'Don\'t be absurd.  ',
'I\'m calling Hal.  ',
'Oh, you are absolutely not.  Will, get down here right now!  ',
'Just stop it.  He\'s not even here.  He\'s -- he\'s in school.  ',
'Hal told me he kept him home from school today, Emily.  ',
'Okay, all right, all right.  Just calm down, okay?  Because if you really did escape, for God\'s sake, keep him out of this. ',
'I will take that under advisement.  Will, I need to speak -- ',
'He can\'t hear you, all right?  He\'s listening to music on his headphones.  So just leave him alone.  ',
'Well, then, I\'m going upstairs.  ',
'The only way you\'re going up those stairs is if you go through me, lady.  ',
'Hey!  What\'s going on?  Mom, is that you?  ',
'It\'s a good thing this house has such a deep well. ',
'How long were we in there?  ',
'At least 40,000 gallons worth I\'m sure.  But it was worth it.  You know, you give great shower.  Did I mention that I love you?  ',
'I don\'t know.  You know, I had a lot of water in my ears.  I\'m not sure I heard.  ',
'Well, I might have to say it again.  I do.  I love you, Mike kasnoff.  ',
'I love you, too.  I love you.  All right, it\'s a big decision.  Do we have some breakfast, or do we go to sleep?  ',
'Mm.  Go back to asleep, okay?  ',
'Okay.  ',
'Sweet dreams.  ',
'So you\'re not hungry at all? ',
'Mm, not so much.  ',
'Maybe a big, tall glass of orange juice cold.  Very tall.  ',
'You\'re starving, aren\'t you?  ',
'I could eat.  ',
'Okay.  Okay, stay right here.  I\'ll be right back.  ',
'Can you answer that?  ',
'Hello?  Hello?  Is anybody there?  ',
'Thank you for the coffee and the conversation.  ',
'Well, you\'re welcome for the coffee, but you did most of the talking.  It seems like it was quite a scene down there in the court this morning, yeah?  ',
'And it\'s not over. ',
'Hmm?  ',
'Will you tell Holden to give me a call if he has any questions?  ',
'Yes, yes, I will.  ',
'Thank you.  ',
'Bye, bye.  ',
'Thanks again.  Bye.  ',
'Bye.  ',
'You\'re still here?  ',
'I have a taxi coming.  ',
'You want to tell me what you and Craig were talking about?  ',
'Uh, he was thinking about a single process.  You know, something to cover the gray in his temple area.  ',
'You may as well tell me, Mitzi.  I\'m going to find out anyway.  ',
'You know what?  Why don\'t you just get off my back, Carly?!  What I do, what I\'ve done, it\'s none of your beeswax. ',
'You\'re still hiding something, Mitzi.  Don\'t you know by now I\'m gonna find out what it is?  ',
'Do you want to quiz each other on julius caesar?  ',
'I already know it.  ',
'The whole play?  ',
'\"Friends, romans, countrymen, lend me your lips.\" ',
'Um, we\'re supposed to be studying.  ',
'So we\'re taking a break.  ',
'I\'ll get us some lemonade.  ',
'Wait, lucy, we\'ve got the whole place to ourselves.  Why don\'t we make the most of it?  ',
'Clark, I\'m sorry.  But I -- I can\'t.  It\'s not you.  You\'re a great guy.  ',
'It\'s Aaron.  You\'re still stuck on him, aren\'t you? ',
'No, no.  Aaron\'s -- he\'s married.  ',
'Then why don\'t you give me a chance?  ',
'I just don\'t want to be pushed, okay?  ',
'Got it.  Hanging out with you, my grades are definitely going to go up.  ',
'Aaron?  Are you the one who paged me?  ',
'Yeah, yeah.  I can\'t find ali.  Do you know where she is?  ',
'Have you tried her cell?  ',
'Yeah, I called her.  She\'s not calling me back.  I left messages.  ',
'You two have a fight?  ',
'Well, not exactly.  Things between us aren\'t -- aren\'t so good.  ',
'Well, that happens.  Particularly, in your situation.  I\'m sure you\'ll work it out.  Just be receptive when she gets home. ',
'Home where?  ',
'Your apartment, where else?  ',
'She\'s not staying there.  ',
'But she told me that -- she moved out of my place last night.  She told me she was moving in with you.  ',
'No.  I figured she was staying with you.  ',
'Oh.  No need to panic.  Um, she\'s probably with Hal and Emily.  ',
'Do you want me to call them?  ',
'No, I\'ll -- I\'ll take care of it.  ',
'When are we getting a divorce?  ',
'Right.  How long are we talking about?  ',
'Just a couple of days max, but you just can\'t say anything to anyone.  ',
'Oh, ali, what have you done?    ',
'This is some kind of mistake.  I\'ve never been to any of these websites.  ',
'Of course, he would deny it.  He was willing to let his own mother go to jail for what he did. ',
'There has to be some other explanation.  I -- I have no idea how any of this got on my computer.  ',
'Check the password.  Just an idea.  Is it yours, paulie, or is it your mom\'s?  ',
'Where did you get it?  ',
'The mouthwash?  In her medicine cabinet.  ',
'The methanol.  ',
'Hal, you told me that methanol can be used in household products like paint thinner?  ',
'That\'s right.  ',
'Oh, my God. ',
'Hey, Princess.  It\'s time to wake up. ',
'Ridge! ',
'Hey. ',
'Hi. ',
'Boy, the kids must have really worn you out.  You didn\'t even  make it up to your room last night you were so tired I guess. ',
'Uh, it\'s not my -- um, it wasn\'t made up. ',
'Well, you didn\'t have to sleep on the couch. ',
'I just came over to watch the kids. ',
'It wasn\'t too much trouble? ',
'No, not at all. ',
'Yeah.  Oh, yeah, lots of fun.  I\'m sure they\'ll tell you all about  it when they get up.  Anyway, I should be going. ',
'So soon, huh? ',
'Well, you\'re home now. ',
'Look, if you\'re still tired, you\'re welcome to catch a few more  hours up on my bed. ',
'Oh!  That\'s okay.  That\'s fine.  Thanks anyway though.    ',
'At least let me fix you some breakfast.  I was gonna make some  pancakes for the kids. ',
'Uh, maybe another time, huh? ',
'Bridget, what\'s going on?  You seem so anxious to get out of  here. ',
'Oh, I told you, I\'m really busy.  ',
'Princess -- I can tell you\'re really uncomfortable.  Something  else is going on here.  Tell me what it is. ',
'Uh, oh!  You know what?  I left my purse upstairs.  I\'m just  gonna run upstairs and get it and -- and then I have to go.  So, um -- sorry. ',
'Hey, you\'re back! ',
'Hi!  How was hope? ',
'Ah, she was an Angel.  She\'s down in day care. ',
'Yeah, I just saw her. ',
'Obviously you haven\'t been home yet. ',
'No.  I thought I\'d come in and sign these reports first. ',
'You woke up thinking of work?  ',
'Marketing needs them by ten. ',
'Hello!  Shouldn\'t you be out celebrating?  You just spent the  night with Ridge! ',
'Well, that was an accident.  We got snowed in. ',
'Yeah.  Must be nice to have mother nature on your side, huh? ',
'I guess so. ',
'It was one of the most romantic nights of my life. ',
'No, we didn\'t. ',
'You didn\'t? ',
'No.  Ridge and I didn\'t sleep together. ',
'I heard you got snowed in at the cabin. ',
'You heard that, huh? ',
'Yes.  Well, honey, it\'s my cabin.  The caretaker called me.   He just wanted to make sure you got home all right.  ',
'Yeah, I just walked in. ',
'I came over because I thought maybe the children, you  know, might be upset that you weren\'t here last night.  And I was gonna  take them out for breakfast. ',
'Oh, well, they\'re still sleeping. ',
'Oh.  Well, why didn\'t you call me?  I would have come and  gotten them and taken them over to my house.  They could\'ve stayed with  me. ',
'They were fine.  Bridget stayed here. ',
'Oh, all right.  So what were you doing at the cabin? ',
'Skiing with Brooke. ',
'You spent the night in the cabin with Brooke?  ',
'We intended to be back for dinner last night and we got snowed  in. ',
'You slept with her? ',
'What?! ',
'I knew it.  I knew this was coming.  It was just a matter of  time.  I knew it. ',
'No, mother, not that it\'s any of your business.  But, no, I did not  sleep with Brooke last night.  And not because I didn\'t want to. ',
'Okay, wait a minute.  I\'m a little confused.  You said nothing  happened? ',
'We didn\'t cross that line.  ',
'But you said it was the most romantic night of your life. ',
'It was. ',
'But you didn\'t --',
'No, we didn\'t. ',
'Then why are you acting so happy? ',
'Because I am. ',
'You\'re not disappointed? ',
'No.  It was my decision. ',
'Okay, wait.  You mean Ridge wanted to and you said no? ',
'That\'s right. ',
'Okay.  Now I\'m really confused. ',
'I just thought we should wait. ',
'For what? ',
'And when will that be? ',
'Well, I believe it\'s traditional to wait until you\'re married. ',
'The wedding night?  It\'s -- that\'s good.  That\'s -- that\'s really  good, you know? ',
'No, I am not playing games here.  I was really serious about  this. ',
'No, no, no.  I\'m not doggin\' you.  I think it\'s a great idea. ',
'I want to make sure I heard you correctly.  Brooke Logan  turned down the chance to seduce a Forrester man? ',
'I\'m not gonna discuss this with you. ',
'She must have given you a reason. ',
'No reason I\'m gonna tell you. ',
'Well, you don\'t have to be defensive about it. ',
'Mother, I\'m not gonna stand here and discuss my sex life with  you.  I\'m sorry. ',
'You just said you didn\'t have sex. ',
'I don\'t want to get into this, okay? ',
'She\'s playing hard to get. ',
'No, she isn\'t. ',
'Oh, yes, she is. ',
'Actually, she thinks we should wait.  ',
'For what? ',
'She thinks we shouldn\'t rush into anything, huh? ',
'Oh, my God!  She wants a commitment. ',
'Well, you say that like there\'s something wrong with it. ',
'Well, that\'s the oldest trick in the world. ',
'Right.  She\'s just become more cunning and devious.  Me  on.  You can do it. ',
'This is fascinating!  Now you\'re suspicious because Brooke  didn\'t try to seduce me. ',
'This is just a ploy. ',
'I get it.  She\'s damned if she does and damned if she doesn\'t. ',
'Do I really have to remind you of all the trouble that that  woman caused with your marriage? ',
'See, that\'s what I\'m talking about.  You\'re still livin\' in the past.   You have not realized or you will not admit that Brooke has changed. ',
'Well, I thought she had until she started making moves on  you. ',
'See, I\'m not gonna get into this same old debate with you.  I  don\'t want to do that, mother.  ',
'Ridge, this is not what Taylor wanted for you and the  children. ',
'Taylor resolved her issues with Brooke a long time ago. ',
'Yeah, because she was a very compassionate woman.  But  she would not want her in your bed. ',
'Okay, that\'s it.  I\'m gonna go out and get some air because it\'s  getting rather oppressive in here, okay? ',
'I\'m just concerned about you. ',
'Will you do me a favor and take care of the kids when Bridget  leaves? ',
'Where are you going? ',
'Tell Thomas and the girls I\'ll be back very soon. ',
'Ridge, I\'m talking to you!  ',
'I\'ll miss you. ',
'Oh, Ridgie-poo, you forgot something! ',
'Oh, boy, did he ever.  He\'s forgotten how cunning and  deceptive you really are.  But I haven\'t. ',
'What are you doing here, Stephanie?  ',
'What are you up to? ',
'I\'m not up to anything.  I just brought Ridge back his --',
'His what? ',
'His ski gloves.  We went skiing yesterday. ',
'Yes, I heard all about it. ',
'Oh!  So then you must have heard how we spent the night  together in the cabin. ',
'Yes, and I\'m still trying to figure out how you managed a  snow storm. ',
'Oh, no.  You think I planned that snow storm? ',
'I am not being manipulative. ',
'You slammed the brakes on last night, didn\'t you? ',
'Yes.  And that should make you very happy. ',
'He wasn\'t ready and you knew it.  You\'re playing him.  I\'m  not gonna let you get away with it. ',
'Stephanie, I\'ve been nothing but considerate and respectful of  your son\'s feelings. ',
'You\'re taking advantage at a time when he is vulnerable and  lonely. ',
'Which is why I think we have to take things slow. ',
'Brooke, this isn\'t gonna go anywhere.  You\'re just a  temporary diversion. ',
'All right.  I think you better stop right there before you say  something you\'re going to regret. ',
'What I regret is that I thought you were capable of putting  the needs of the family over your libido. ',
'This isn\'t about sex! ',
'Oh, it isn\'t?  Oh, how many times have I heard you say,  \"I\'m so lonely\"? ',
'A future with you? ',
'I don\'t know.  I really don\'t know what\'s gonna happen there.   All I can tell you is that I love Ridge.  I love him more than anything in  this world. ',
'If you really loved him, Brooke, you\'d back off.  But you  want him to make some kind of a commitment. ',
'Well, maybe someday he will. ',
'Not with you! ',
'Is there anybody  out there who is  more right for  Ridge than I am?   Is there?   ',
'Is it Ridge you\'re talking about?  Ridge and me?   ',
'No. No, it can\'t be. ',
'Hello?',
'Good morning, Jack.',
'What do you want, Diane?',
'Ooh. My, my. Somebody got up on the wrong side of the bed  this morning.',
'Is this about Kyle\'s visit later? I hope you\'re not calling to cancel.',
'No, nothing like that, although I should warn you that our son  isn\'t feeling well.',
'What\'s the matter with him?',
'Oh, he has a terrible cold-- runny nose, sneezing, the whole  thing.',
'Have you taken him to the pediatrician?',
'Uh, not yet.',
'I assume you\'re going to.',
'I will, though what the boy really needs is to get out of this  nasty weather, go someplace warm. ',
'What are you suggesting?',
'I\'m going to petition a judge for permission to take Kyle to  Florida.',
'For how long?',
'Oh, I don\'t know. Couple months, maybe.',
'A couple of months?',
'Just until it warms up out here.',
'You have got to be kidding me.',
'I feel it would be best for our son--',
'He\'s a little boy. He has a cold. It is not that big a deal.',
'Maybe not to you.',
'Diane, you\'re overreacting. Either that, or you\'re deliberately  trying to keep him away from me. Which is it?',
'You want Kyle to feel better? Why don\'t you let him live over  here? He\'ll be good as new in no time.',
'You\'ll receive notice of the hearing.',
'No, wait, Diane, wait.',
'Ciao, Jack.',
'(Scratchy voice) I really appreciate this, Paul.',
'Don\'t mention it. Here.',
'The painter said they should be finished with my apartment this  afternoon, so it\'ll just be a couple of days. Pain killers are getting to me.',
'Yeah, not my favorite. Seems to be affecting your voice.',
'You don\'t think Chris will mind if I crash at her place a few  days, do you?',
'No, not at all. It\'s probably a good idea. ',
'All right. Let me know if you need anything else. Thanks  again.',
'You bet.',
'Ahem.',
'Something I can do for you?',
'Yeah. I heard you took Diane on as a client.',
'You heard correct.',
'So you didn\'t have a problem with, um, I mean, as Phyllis\' friend  representing Diane?',
'Actually, I\'m no longer representing Diane. The police have  pretty much dropped the case, or hadn\'t you heard?',
'Oh, no, I heard, but that doesn\'t change what a scum you were for  agreeing to defend her in the first place, now does it? ',
'Every person has a right to legal counsel.',
'Oh, is that how you\'re justifying it?',
'Look, I\'m well aware that Diane isn\'t one of your favorite  people.',
'Well, you know something? Now that I hear who her lawyer was,  I feel sorry for her.',
'Oh. That so?',
'You know what amazes me? How anyone can trust you.',
'You mean the way Christine does? (Doorbell rings)',
'Isabella Williams?',
'Yes?',
'(Southern accent) hi. I\'m Kelly Simmons. I\'m sorry to bother  you so early. I was hoping to have a moment of your time. ',
'I was on my way out.',
'I\'ll just be a moment, I promise. I have a couple of questions  here to ask you.',
'What kind of questions?',
'Regarding a Mr. James Franklin.',
'This has to do with my ex-husband?',
'Yes, it does.',
'Come in.',
'Thank you.  You have a lovely home here.',
'Thank you.',
'Uh, I\'ll get right to the reason for my visit. I\'m not sure if you\'re  aware, but Mr. Franklin is up for parole next month.',
'No, I wasn\'t aware.',
'Yes, it is a work release program. My office is compiling a  report trying to determine if Mr. Franklin is ready to be reintegrated into  the community. ',
'What does that have to do with me?',
'We\'re hoping you\'ll assist us with the evaluation.',
'Me? I haven\'t spoken to James in years.',
'Well, yes, but you were married to the man. I\'d say that would  make you a pretty good judge of his character, wouldn\'t you agree?',
'Well, I suppose, but I--',
'You know, I\'m sure you\'re gonna be a big help. Why don\'t we  just go ahead and get started, shall we?',
'Morning.',
'I thought you\'d already left for the office.',
'I got a late start. Like some breakfast?',
'No. I\'ll get something on the way into work. ',
'How much longer are you gonna continue this... Cold shoulder  routine?',
'Mom up yet?',
'No.',
'Came home last night, she was on the couch. She looked like  she had been crying.',
'She spent the night down here.',
'Why?',
'I don\'t know. I don\'t know what\'s troubling her, all right?',
'Maybe there\'s a reason for that.',
'Meaning what?',
'Well, you\'re not the easiest person to talk to.',
'For your information, I\'ve always listened to what your mother  had to say, all right?',
'Not always with an open mind. You look for an opportunity  to find fault, to tell people how you think they should handle the situation. ',
'It looks like a pretty rough crowd.',
'Ah, I\'ve seen worse. Say, you still haven\'t told me what we\'re  doing here.',
'I heard from our new best friends.',
'You talking about Seth and Robert?',
'Yeah. They wanna meet us. ',
'And what do you think that means?',
'I hope it means they took the bait.',
'You know, these dudes gotta be really desperate for cash.',
'Why do you say that?',
'Larry, it is a setup.',
'Exactly, man. I mean, I\'d never fall for that.',
'Maybe they\'re a lot greedier than they\'re smart.',
'Man, you sure are thirsty for this revenge thing, huh? ',
'You have no idea, Larry. After what they did to me, I wanna  bring these two down. I\'m gonna enjoy every second of it.',
'Here come your boys now. All right, be cool.',
'Well, well, well, you ladies decided to show up.',
'I said we\'d be here.',
'Well, what are we waiting for? Let\'s get down to business.',
'That must be-- that must be Kyle.',
'That\'s right. You haven\'t met.',
'No, we have not met yet. Hey, buddy. How you doing?',
'You wanna hold him?',
'Uh... Sure. Hey, buddy. How you doing there, huh? Huh?  You\'re a good-looking boy.',
'(Babbling)',
'Yeah. He\'s a good-looking little boy.',
'I think so.',
'How you doing?',
'Um, I\'M... I\'m good.',
'You look good. You sure I\'m not interrupting anything here?',
'No, no, no, no. Actually, I was about to call my lawyer.',
'Is everything okay?',
'Well, that\'s what I need to find out. I\'d like to take Kyle down  to Florida for a couple of months, and I, um, first need to petition family  court. ',
'What\'s in Florida?',
'Warm weather. He hasn\'t been feeling very well, and I thought  a little healthy sunshine would be good for him. What?',
'Nothing, nothing. It\'s... It\'s just funny how I can still read you  so well.',
'I\'m not sure what you mean.',
'Diane, why don\'t you admit what you\'re doing? You\'re using  this boy to get back at Jack and Phyllis.',
'Diane said what?',
'You heard me.',
'That is such bull.',
'You\'re damn right it is. This isn\'t about Kyle\'s health. It\'s about  her showing me who\'s the boss.',
'(Scoffs) right. What is wrong with her? You know, don\'t  answer that. We\'ll be here all day. ',
'You know what? I\'m gonna talk to Silva. She thinks she can get  away with this. She better think again.',
'You know what? You and I don\'t need to talk about this.',
'Don\'t worry, honey. It\'s okay.',
'No, you don\'t need to hear me going on about Diane.',
'Oh. Why, because you think I\'m still obsessed?',
'You didn\'t sleep too well last night.',
'No, and that had nothing to do with Diane.',
'You can\'t get her out of your mind.',
'Okay, what do you suggest we do? You\'re certainly not thinking  of going back to that bar. Honey, you very nearly got hurt there.',
'Oh, come on. Those guys were all bark.',
'Not according to Paul.',
'Well, he\'s wrong. We\'re not gonna go back there. It was a dead  end. We won\'t!',
'I\'m gonna call Silva from the study, okay?',
'I have to go, too.',
'Have a good day.',
'Now I said Paul and I won\'t be going back, but, um, I didn\'t  say I won\'t be going back.',
'Here.',
'What\'s this?',
'It\'s a map of the property of the Newman ranch. Thought it  might come in handy. ',
'Good thing. All right. Here\'s how it\'s gonna go down. You know  the security code for the back gate at the ranch, right?',
'Yeah.',
'Okay, so once you\'ve got it disarmed, you go in, open the safe,  then and only then we\'ll show up.',
'Where will the two of you be waiting?',
'Don\'t worry about it.',
'But how are we supposed to, like--',
'So tell me again. What exactly are you two doing to earn your  share?',
'We\'re watching our back, that\'s what.',
'Easy, Bobby. If things get crazy, we\'ll step in and help.',
'Well, how do we know if things get crazy, the two of you won\'t  take off running?',
'With this kind of dough on the line, we\'ll stick around.',
'So we\'re clear on this? We split it four ways?',
'And after that, we don\'t owe each other, right?',
'They don\'t look too smart to me.',
'You know what? So that\'s it. We\'re all set then.',
'I think so.',
'All right, good. Then we\'ll see you guys at the ranch tonight.',
'I don\'t appreciate your tone.',
'I\'m just saying--',
'What are you gonna do about mom?',
'I don\'t know.',
'Has she told you anything?',
'No. And I don\'t wanna talk about that. I wanted to tell you that  I\'M... Happy that you\'ve moved back in here again.',
'Well, it won\'t be for long. ',
'What do you mean, it won\'t be for long? Where do you intend  to go?',
'You really don\'t want me to answer that question, do you?',
'In other words, you\'re talking about Diego?',
'Hoping he got that stupid vendetta out of his system, and if  he has, I\'m gonna buy that condo I had my eye on, and we are gonna move  in together.',
'And if I do it anyway?',
'Then I\'ll hire bodyguards, have them follow you around  wherever you go.',
'(Sighs) right.',
'Watch me. I will do it.',
'I\'m leaving now before I say something I might regret. (Door  slams) ',
'I am not using my son to get back at Jack and Phyllis.',
'Then what would you call it?',
'All I wanna do is take Kyle to Florida for a couple of months. I  just  want him to be healthy and happy. Is that a crime?',
'Okay. So what if I am angry at Jack? Look at everything he\'s  done to me. You have no idea how much he hurt me. Nobody does.',
'Diane, I know you had some very deep feelings for this guy.',
'Diane, your obsession with Jack has brought you a lot of pain  over these years.',
'There have been some good times.',
'Regardless, they\'re in the past now, Diane, and Jack\'s a married  man. He loves his wife, and the only connection you have with Jack is  through your son.',
'That\'s a pretty powerful connection.',
'Well, I don\'t know if I can accept that.',
'No. No, of course not.',
'Hey, check it out.',
'Well, what do you know? She\'s back without her bodyguard. ',
'Yeah. Well, she sure brought her body with her, didn\'t she?  (Laughing)',
'What are you doing back here?',
'Is that how you greet all your customers?',
'I\'m sorry. I can\'t do that, not until I get information on this  woman.',
'I told you last night I\'ve never seen her before.',
'Yeah, I know what you told me. Why don\'t you take a look?  Maybe something else will pop into your head.',
'You know, it didn\'t take you long to mention Chris\' name.',
'Have you heard from Christine?',
'What makes you think I would tell you if I had?',
'I take that as a no.',
'What are you, a mind reader now?',
'So you still think I had something to do with it? ',
'Oh, I know you did, and it must have been serious. What did  you do, Paul?',
'You know something, Baldwin? What goes on between Chris  and me is none of your business.',
'Oh, okay. So you did do something.',
'I didn\'t say that.',
'Then you\'re denying it?',
'I mean, could you do that if you were in my shoes?',
'Oh, considering the circumstances, I think so. A refill.',
'Considering the circumstances?  What does that mean? ',
'What about the christening?',
'Oh, you actually think Chris has been gone all this time  because of that?',
'Yeah, let me remind you, you made quite a scene.',
'Well, you know what? I don\'t know what to tell you.',
'Did you hit her?',
'What?',
'You know, Baldwin, I would never hit a woman, period. ',
'Then what  did you do?!',
'I think this conversation is over.',
'Thank you again for agreeing to help.',
'Can we just hurry this along?',
'Well, certainly. What we are looking for is evidence that Mr.  Franklin is ready to be reintegrated into society.',
'He feels he is?',
'Which is where I come in?',
'I can\'t answer that.',
'When was the last time you spoke with him?',
'It\'s been years.',
'Have you received any letters, correspondence?',
'No.',
'So there\'s been no contact whatsoever.',
'None.',
'I see. Well, now according to my records--let\'s see. Mr. Franklin  was... Already in prison before you came to Geona city, is that correct?',
'That\'s right.',
'Well, you appear to have made a whole new life for yourself-- a  new home, a new husband, a--what, a child here?',
'Yes. Ricky. What does that have to with James? ',
'Just being trough. Tell me, do you feel that Mr. Franklin is a  threat of any kind? If so, I\'d like to include that right here in my report.',
'I don\'t consider James a threat to anyone.',
'Including yourself?',
'I doubt he\'ll want anything to do with me.',
'I see. Is there anything that you feel I should know about your  ex-husband?',
'No.',
'Well, then tell me this here...',
'Hmm. Very well. I will be on my way. Thank you for your time.  I\'ll show myself out.',
'Hey.',
'Hey.',
'I didn\'t think you\'d be here.',
'I wanted to see you. I missed you.',
'I\'ve missed you, too. How have you been?',
'Not so good.',
'Same here.',
'I wish it could be like that. ',
'You\'d better get that picture out of my face, lady.',
'Listen to me. This woman\'s name is Diane Jenkins, and I\'m  almost positive she hired somebody from this neighborhood to do a job for  her.',
'Well, so what?',
'Now I didn\'t say that she came in here. I\'m saying the guy she  hired probably has been in here. ',
'Oh, and now you think he\'s just gonna walk right up to you and  start talking.',
'Yeah, yeah. Maybe he will if he\'s thirsty enough, yeah.',
'(Sighs)',
'So I\'m just gonna sit here and wait for him to walk in the door.  Do you have a problem with that?',
'Yeah, I got a problem with that. That\'s not all right with me.',
'I\'ll buy a drink.',
'Mnh-mnh. I got the right to refuse service to anybody.',
'This guy giving you a hard time, sweetheart?',
'No, I can handle this.',
'Let her stay. She gives the place class.',
'Look, I\'m telling you now, butch, don\'t be starting nothing here  tonight, or you\'re outta here for good. (Telephone rings) ',
'Get the phone.',
'Hey, be careful. (Ring)',
'You look good in that outfit.',
'Thank you.',
'I bet you look good out of it, too.',
'(Chuckles)',
'Have you seen this woman?',
'Is that the same picture you showed us last night?',
'Yeah, I\'m still looking for her.',
'That\'s too bad she\'s lost. We could have had a real party.  (Chuckles)',
'Have you seen her? She was wearing a red wig, probably  looked like the color of my hair.',
'Oh, wait a minute. Yeah, I think I seen her. ',
'You have?',
'Howie, isn\'t that your sister?',
'Hey, you oughta know, huh?',
'Okay. That\'s funny, that\'s funny. You haven\'t seen her.',
'No, but I\'d sure like to.',
'Yeah, right. Nice talking to ya.',
'Hey, baby, don\'t turn away from me. Hey, you disrespectin\'  me? Look at me, sweetheart.',
'Whoa, whoa! Get your hand off of me.',
'No need to be feisty.',
'I said, get your hand off of me!',
'You got a lot of gall, lady. In case you don\'t realize it, you\'re  not on your home turf. It might be smart for you to be a little friendlier. ',
'Really, really? I\'ll be friendly. Just don\'t touch me again. Do  you understand that? Can you handle that? (Telephone rings)',
'Michael Baldwin.',
'It\'s me.',
'Isabella, what\'s wrong?',
'Some woman was here--Kelly Simmons-- asking questions  about James.',
'What kind of questions?',
'She said he was going to be up for parole.',
'Already?',
'I know. I was surprised myself. Apparently she\'s gathering  information about whether he should be rehabilitated and wanted my  opinion.',
'Is this someone you\'ve spoken to before? ',
'No.',
'And are you sure? Maybe back when James was arrested?',
'Yes, I\'m sure, Michael. I\'ve never seen this woman before in  my life.',
'That\'s okay. Okay. Just tell me how you handled it.',
'Well, I think I did okay. I got her out of here as quickly as  possible.',
'Is Paul home?',
'No, thank God.',
'Well, good, good. The last thing you need is for him to be  reminded of James and all the sort of things you two were involved in.',
'I know. I know, Michael. I hope she doesn\'t come back. Are  you there?',
'Yeah, I\'m still here. ',
'Well, do you think she\'s gonna come back?',
'Uh, I gotta go. I\'ll talk to you later.',
'Please, tell me this is over.',
'I can\'t do that yet. Not yet.',
'Not yet?',
'It\'ll be over tonight.',
'What\'s that supposed to mean?',
'You know what? Can we just not talk about this now? ',
'No, let\'s talk about it. I want to know what happens tonight.  Answer me! You found them, didn\'t you? You know who they are.',
'Yes.',
'Did you call the police, for God sake?',
'No.',
'Why not?! Have them arrested.',
'I can\'t do that.',
'Fine, then I\'ll do it.',
'You know what? I can\'t let you do that, Victoria.',
'Why?',
'Because you\'ll ruin everything.',
'What\'s going on, Diego?',
'No, it\'s better if you don\'t know the details. All I can say is that  I have a way to nail these guys, and I\'m gonna make them pay for what  they did to me. ',
'Why are you acting like this?',
'I don\'t expect you to understand. I\'m not asking you to  understand. Just promise me you will not interfere.',
'So I\'m supposed to just sit back and let you get yourself  killed.',
'That\'s not going to happen.',
'How do you know?! These people are criminals. I mean, they  already put you in the hospital once, and now you\'re going back for more?',
'It\'s something that I have to do.',
'Why, because of your macho pride? That is such a load of  crap.',
'This is not just for me. It\'s for you, too. Your father--everything  I\'ve tried to do to make him understand. But it didn\'t work. If I can do  this... ',
'All right, you know what? Can we not argue about this?',
'Victoria!',
'You think you can boss me around or something?',
'I want to be alone. Is that okay with you?',
'A hot chick like you should never be alone.',
'When I want you to touch me, I\'ll let you know.',
'When do you think that\'ll be?',
'Don\'t hold your breath.',
'Check it out, fellas. We can look, but we can\'t touch.',
'That ain\'t fair.',
'No way. Hang down in the breeze, and it\'s public property.',
'Oh, yeah. Very nice.',
'Get your hands off of me. I\'m warning you. I\'m telling you, get  your hands off of me!',
'Aah! (Groaning) you stupid bitch! ',
'Pretty rough.',
'Oh, yeah.',
'What the hell\'s going on out here?! Back off, butch!',
'Nothing, rob. We\'re cool. We\'re cool, rob. We\'re cool. It\'s her,  man.',
'Take it easy. All right, that\'s it. You\'re outta here, lady.',
'Fine. Whatever.',
'Now!',
'Okay, I\'m going!',
'All right, let\'s go. Come on. Thank you. Let\'s go. Buy you a  drink.',
'(Slurring) hey. I know her.',
'You do?',
'Yeah,  I did a little job for her.',
'What kind of job?',
'Phone work.',
'Phone work? ',
'Yeah, she gave me money, and I made a call.',
'How long ago was this?',
'Oh... I don\'t know. A few months maybe. I don\'t remember.',
'Are you sure it was her?',
'Yeah, I think so.',
'It is so important that you\'re sure it\'s her. I mean, you have no  idea how important that is.',
'A drink-- that might help sharpen things for me.',
'Are you working me?',
'(Chuckles) well, maybe. But the dame does look kind of  familiar. So how about that drink?',
'What do you want?',
'I need to talk to you.',
'You get off my property now.',
'Please, Mr. Newman, you have to hear this. ',
'The only sound I want to hear is your car getting out of my  driveway, got that?',
'It\'s about the guys who stole your money. I\'ve been in contact  with them.',
'I\'m amazed you\'re still alive.',
'Yeah, I\'m alive. But they may not be, not after you\'re through  with them.',
'What are you talking about?',
'They\'re coming here... Today. (Telephone rings) (ring)',
'Hello?',
'Is Paul home yet?',
'No.',
'What about Ricky? You tied down?',
'No, he\'s at the sitter\'s. Why? ',
'I don\'t think we should get into this over the phone.',
'Is it about the woman who was here today?',
'Yes. Didn\'t make sense to me-- James being considered for  early parole. He got sent up for some very serious crimes, so I called the  prison in green bay.',
'And?',
'James isn\'t being considered for early parole or work  release... Not for quite some time.',
'Well, then what was the Kelly person doing here, asking all  those questions?',
'I don\'t know, but I don\'t like it. Get over here right away.',
'Yeah, I\'m on my way. ',
'How did it go?',
'Very... Very interesting.',
'Mom, sit down, all right? Ross is going to be here any minute.',
'Maybe he won\'t show up. Maybe he\'s heard about my hideous  crime, and he wants no part of me.',
'Please don\'t talk about that, mom.',
'Can you smell the witch hunt in the air?',
'Oh, hi, honey. Hello, Holly.',
'Hey.',
'Blake, I came as soon as I got your message, which I must admit  made very little sense to me. What\'s this about Holly and Reva?',
'Let me introduce myself: Reva\'s new stalker.',
'What?',
'Someone\'s been harassing Reva. They... They broke into her  house, they left crank phone calls.  ',
'Yeah, that much I know, and the police apprehended the man.',
'The wrong man. Either that or someone\'s picked up where they  left off.',
'The calls have started again?',
'And someone broke in. Smeared a message on her wall.',
'Among other things.',
'Yeah, a real sicko.',
'What does this have to do with Holly?',
'Well, Reva believes that whoever is responsible is someone she. ',
'And the police, in particular my old friend Frank Cooper, seem  to have convinced her that it\'s me.',
'Why would Holly do this?',
'We\'re not saying it was definitely her.',
'Reva...  ',
'We\'re not! We need to step back, all of us, and look at this  objectively.',
'Look, somebody took fake blood and put it on your dry cleaning.  That\'s a fact, right?',
'And a pretty clear message.',
'And Holly was the one who dropped it off.',
'That doesn\'t make her the vandal. Because the evidence... Oh,  my God, the evidence! Listen to me.',
'Yeah, but we\'re talking about a crime that\'s been committed here,  Reva. It\'s harassment at the very least.',
'But it\'s Holly we\'re talking about. She\'s my boss. And more  importantly, she\'s a friend.  ',
'That\'s exactly right. And we also know that the clothes, when  they left the shop, were not in this condition. Holly says so herself.',
'But why would she say something so incriminating if she were  the one responsible?',
'Reva, I don\'t know. I\'m just trying to put together all the pieces  like you are.',
'Okay, Frank, your man, tucker, he said that no one else  approached after Holly who might have done this, right?',
'Yeah. I mean, tucker\'s a good man, Josh. But come on,  guarding a house is not rocket science here.  ',
'He may have looked away. He might have missed something.',
'That may be the explanation we want to hear. But maybe the  reality is staring us right in the face, Reva. It was Holly.',
'You\'re sure this proxy will give me Phillip\'s vote at the board  meeting?',
'If he signs it-- which he won\'t do if he\'s in his right mind.',
'I didn\'t ask you for an editorial.',
'I\'m your lawyer. You pay me to advise you on business  manners.',
'Well, this is more personal.',
'Alan, in my experience, people don\'t volunteer to sign away  their rights in billion-dollar corporations.  ',
'You let me handle that end of things. You\'ll be busy drawing up  a trust fund document for the child my wife is expecting.',
'Assuming she is in fact pregnant.',
'Oh, she is pregnant, and we will reconcile as a result. Of those  two things I am absolutely certain.',
'You wanted to see me, sir?',
'Yes, Ben, I need your help, and it\'s urgent. I want you to take  these papers to the hospital and get Phillip\'s signature on them.',
'Sure. That\'s it?',
'I\'m on my way.',
'Like candy from a baby.',
'Oh! I\'m sorry. Sorry.',
'What\'s wrong? Did something happen?',
'It\'s more about what\'s going to happen.',
'Holly, are sure that Reva\'s convinced that you are the one who  did it?',
'She didn\'t dismiss it out of hand. That\'s all I needed to hear.',
'Yeah, well, that\'s a bit upsetting, considering that Reva\'s a  friend.',
'What\'s upsetting is that I seem to be the only possibility.',
'It\'s... It\'s complicated.',
'Complicated because of your past and the incident with the  children.',
'Yeah, well, what else? Was I seen pouring the blood on her  clothes? Do I suddenly have this vendetta against Reva out of the blue?',
'Yeah, that whole mess happened years ago.',
'Four. She was drinking.  ',
'Well, I\'m a raging drunk again. I trashed her clothes in the  middle of a blackout.',
'Holly, anger is not going to help you.',
'You know that\'s what everybody is thinking. And if they\'re all  so convinced I did it, what was the point of that A.A. And rehab...',
'Oh, please, mom, stop talking like that, all right?',
'...Therapy?',
'Holly... Wait a minute. You weren\'t arrested, right? You weren\'t  taken in for questioning, is that correct?',
'No.',
'Right. No charges have been filed against you?',
'So far.',
'So that tells us two things: Number one, not everybody is  convinced that you vandalized Reva\' property. It also tells us that we have  time.  ',
'For what?',
'Well, to make Reva and Frank, Josh and whoever else, make  them believe that they\'re wrong about you.',
'If they are wrong.',
'Everything in me is saying that Holly would never ever do  something like this.',
'Frank, did anyone else approach the house after Holly?',
'Yeah, a mailman and Blake.',
'Yeah, and Blake was with me when I found the clothes.',
'My man was doing his job, Josh. But I can\'t interrogate every  single person that comes within a hundred yards of your house.',
'Well, that\'s too bad, because you might have been able to stop  this.',
'You know what? This is great. Let\'s just duke it out and maybe  we\'ll find the clue to who this is that\'s doing this.',
'I\'m sorry, okay? Frank, I\'m sorry. I shouldn\'t let my frustrations  speak for me.',
'Josh, we\'re all trying to find answers.',
'I refuse to believe this was Holly.',
'History? Don\'t tell me about her history. I was the one who  talked her down the last time, remember?',
'\"Talked her down.\" You just made my point for me.',
'Holly is stressed; she\'s not psycho. And Frank is going to have  to come up with so more solid facts before I\'ll think otherwise. ( Phone  rings )',
'It\'s Ross. Hello?  ',
'Josh, it\'s Ross. Listen, I have been speaking with Blake and  Holly.',
'Really? How are they doing?',
'Not very good. It seems we have a bit of a situation on our  hands.',
'I think that\'s a fair assessment.',
'And I would like to nip it in the bud.',
'What do you suggest?',
'A meeting. I\'m sure that we can sort things out. Listen, I\'m at  Infierno. Could you come by?',
'Yeah, we\'ll be there.',
'Don\'t go in. Zach\'s asleep.',
'Ah... Where\'s Phillip?',
'Oh, he left a while ago, and I sent Harley home so she could get  some sleep, too.  ',
'Uh-huh, uh-huh. You spoke to Harley. Oh, is that why  you\'re standing guard at Zach\'s door so I won\'t just waltz in and menace  the poor thing?',
'Oh, I don\'t know what to expect from you.',
'Harley\'s still angry.',
'Oh, come on. Everything ended up well, Buzz.',
'Oh, yes, yes, as opposed to the perfect behavior he might  witness at the Spaulding mansion.',
'Ain\'t life ironic.',
'Yeah, yeah, yeah.',
'Yeah.',
'Well, it\'s the truth. ( Laughs ) and I\'m so glad you  understand.  ',
'Maybe better than you like.',
'Okay, what are you saying?',
'Oh, come on! This campaign isn\'t about love of family. You\'re  lying through your teeth.',
'Okay, what\'s going to happen?',
'Well, I...',
'What?',
'I\'m going to go home and take a nap. It\'s been quite a day.',
'No, wait a minute. That\'s not what you started to say.',
'You know what? Spare me the mind reading. I\'m really tired.',
'Olivia, just tell me what it is.',
'Just... What do you think it is?',
'I don\'t know.  ',
'Forget it. I\'m not getting into this with you right now. Leave me  alone.',
'Hang on a second. Is this about the conversation we had  before?',
'Which one? The one where you told me it was a mistake that  you ever cared for me, let alone slept with me? Never mind how you felt.',
'Oh, that. Okay.',
'Hey, you know what? Forget about it. It\'s gone out of my head.  I\'ve been a little preoccupied with Alan and his lawyer going over divorce  terms.',
'Didn\'t know that was moving so fast.',
'Neither did I, till I had the document in my hand. It\'s quite a  shock, especially now.  ',
'You\'re having second thoughts about leaving him, aren\'t you?',
'I\'m worn out. Why don\'t we go our separate ways and pretend  it\'s for the best?',
'No... No. No, let\'s not.',
'Why do you to continue talking about this when all we ever  were to each other was a mistake, Phillip?',
'What difference does it make? It\'s not going to change our  situation is it? Oh, no, we don\'t have a situation. We mean nothing to each  other now.  ',
'Okay, all right, I think I got it now. So I tell you that we\'ve got  no future, and all of a sudden you\'re waffling on divorcing Alan. Is that it?',
'Oh, trust me, honey, you\'re not that desirable.',
'Is that what you really think it is?  ',
'I don\'t know. Do I have it wrong?',
'No, you\'re right on target as usual. Yeah, I am exactly the kind  of person that you think I am, sweetie.',
'Okay.',
'I\'m shallow.',
'Okay, all right. Well, Olivia, if I\'ve got it wrong, explain it to  me then.',
'Hey, what you see is what you get, or at least what you got.',
'Mmm... ( laughs ) now, see, we always end up fighting, don\'t  we? Wonder why that is?',
'I\'m sure you have the answer to that, too.',
'Never mind. Hey, I was not trying to judge you. Sorry.',
'I\'m sorry to interrupt.  ',
'That\'s...',
'I\'ve been waiting for you.',
'It\'s okay. We\'re finished.',
'Well, that\'s one of the things I admire most about you,  Buzz: Your ability to speak your mind even when you are wrong.  ',
'( Laughs ) I\'m not wrong about this, and I don\'t expect a mea  culpa. You don\'t seem to be operating that way these days.',
'These days? Meaning what?',
'Oh, my God. You know, I\'m really sorry you feel that way,  Buzz.',
'What... And this, this. What is this? What is this? You know,  this not sticking up for yourself. That tells me something\'s going on.',
'( Sighs ) and what? What is this? I mean, you\'re turning  into your family, huh? Turning to sleuthing?  ',
'Well, Harley thinks that the custody case explains it all. She  thinks you\'re just, you know, you\'re on a mission to fix up your family.',
'Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And I take it, you don\'t agree.',
'Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine. You\'re such a detective, what\'s  your proof?',
'Oh, come on, Buzz, why would I keep up a charade like  that?',
'Well, because it\'s easier for you to let Harley think it\'s Zach  rather than get to wondering what was really driving you.',
'Uh-huh. Like you\'re doing right now?',
'That\'s right.',
'Uh-huh. ( Sighs ) well, I suppose you won\'t believe me.  But I am... I am actually trying to fix things, not make things worse, Buzz.',
'Oh, I definitely need some proof to... To buy that.',
'Mm-hmm.',
'But I don\'t expect truth from you, you know. So I\'ll give you  some.',
'Oh, all right.',
'I\'m a lot more fun than Phillip.',
'Yeah, well, I\'m looking for Phillip.',
'It\'s ten seconds later than last time you looked. What is the big  deal about seeing Phillip?',
'I\'ve got to get him to sign these.',
'Are they important?',
'Yeah, Alan said they were.',
'Oh, the boss man himself sent you, huh? What are they about?',
'I don\'t know. Don\'t... No.',
'You mean, you haven\'t looked?',
'No.',
'Come on, come on, they\'re probably nothing. They\'re probably  like inner- office memos or paper clip invoices or something...  ',
'Yeah, but why don\'t you just come out and say \"read them\"?',
'Well, you know, you might find something interesting in  there. Or you might completely blow it. It\'s basically up to you.',
'Some choice.',
'Yeah.',
'Spaulding made bids on some great companies. That\'d be a good  acquisition. Shoot, sneak peek\'s over. Shoot... Phillip, hi.',
'Hey, Ben.',
'Listen, I\'m sorry to hear about Zach. I was looking for you at the  hospital. They said come over here.',
'Oh, yeah, I just stopped off to order him something in the gift  shop. Why? What\'s up?  ',
'I just need you to sign some things for me.',
'I don\'t have time to look at paperwork right now. I\'ve got to get  back and talk to one of Zach\'s doctors, so...',
'Yeah, well, that\'s why your dad sent me to make it easier for you,  so I\'ll just wait here while you sign these and I\'ll bring them back for you.',
'Oh, oh, oh, well. No, too good an offer to pass up.',
'Thank you for coming by. I\'d like to sort this out before it gets  out of control.',
'It may be too late for that.',
'Holly, I don\'t believe that.',
'Why don\'t we all just sit down?',
'Isn\'t this cozy? Just like old times.  ',
'Reva, to start things off, do you honestly believe that Holly  would ever do anything to harm you?',
'No, I don\'t believe that.',
'So much for honesty right off the bat.',
'Mom...',
'Holly is the one who dropped off the blood-stained dry-cleaning  in the house.',
'Dropped off the dry- cleaning. There was no blood anywhere.',
'Now, there could be a logically explanation for what happened,  Josh.',
'I agree. Unfortunately, we may already have it.',
'Then there\'s nothing else to say, is there?',
'I\'m with you, Holly. I don\'t believe that you did this.  ',
'Okay, then, Reva, why don\'t you tell us what you think  happened?',
'Wait a minute. What she thinks happened? Ross, I don\'t  appreciate you trying to put Reva on the defensive.',
'Josh, it\'s all right.',
'I...',
'We walk in, there\'s a full-fledged conference going on.',
'I never... I\'m sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, Josh.',
'Well, what\'s the point here? I mean, you\'ve already decided I\'m  the demon of the dry- cleaning.  ',
'No, mom, we just want to have a conversation.',
'A conversation is fine. I just don\'t want Reva put into a position  where she has to explain herself. She\'s been through enough already.',
'Yes, I understand that.',
'Don\'t take it that way please.',
'Bring on the polygraph. Give me the truth serum.',
'Did you see anyone after you left the shop, someone who might  back you up?',
'I\'ve been through this with the police.',
'Go through it with me again, please.',
'But you were upset at the time.',
'( Laughs ) I was upset... You know, I run a television station.  You get the news the ratings are down, it tends to bother you a little bit,  but not...  ',
'And you really needed Reva to come through on that big story  with the Spauldings to help boost the ratings.',
'Well, only if she would give it her full attention, check the facts,  or we would have a lawsuit on our hands, which could be worse than low  ratings.',
'Well, then, there\'s my motivation.',
'All right, Holly, that\'s enough. Listen, Josh, people can be upset,  they can be furious without slipping into pathological behavior.',
'I understand, Ross. But some people have had problems with that  kind of behavior, and those problems don\'t go away just because you want  them to be gone.',
'My mother is fine.',
'No one\'s accusing her of anything, Blake.',
'No, Reva. You\'re just conveniently dredging up the worse  episode of my life to fit your profile.',
'We\'re just trying to get the bottom of it. That\'s it.',
'Would everybody just take a deep breath and calm down?',
'Holly, were you placed on any medication after the kidnapping?  ',
'Josh, I don\'t want you to go there.',
'And if you were, are you still taking it? ( Cell phone rings )',
'You want to come home with me and check out my medicine  cabinet?',
'Are you going to answer that, mom?',
'No. ( Cell phone ringing ) what? No. I said \"no comment.\" Isn\'t  that nice?',
'A reporter?',
'From \"the mirror.\" I guess someone at the police station that  this would make a juicy story.',
'For the competition?',
'Yeah, they\'re doing a piece on the alleged crime and they  wanted my quote. Mine\'s unprintable.  ',
'I\'d be happy to call that reporter back and tell him that those  accusations are ungrounded if you can just help me to understand why  they are.',
'She\'s not guilty until proven otherwise.',
'You could have fooled me.',
'You know, I think this is getting us nowhere.',
'I can\'t prove I\'m innocent if everyone is going to think the worst  of me.',
'Nobody wants to hurt you, Holly.',
'No?',
'No. This is about protecting Reva, not about attacking you.',
'Isn\'t it always about protecting Reva? Great meeting. Very  productive.',
'I\'m sorry. I honestly thought that this would work.  ',
'Me, too. Poor Holly.',
'Hey, pop. You okay?',
'I\'m trying to concentrate on one terrific thing: Zach is going to  be okay. The rest is garbage. Your shift over?',
'No, not exactly. Listen, I don\'t mean to bring up some more  garbage, but, you know, when you and Holly broke up?',
'Yes.',
'Well, was it a friendly breakup or were there fireworks?',
'No fireworks was why we broke up.  ',
'Has Holly seemed any different to you lately?',
'You\'re asking for a reason, but you\'re not going to tell me,  correct?',
'Correct.',
'That\'s what I was afraid of.',
'All right, there you go.',
'Thanks, Marina.',
'You\'re welcome.',
'All right, Ben, that ought to do it.',
'Thank you very much, and I\'ll get these back to your dad.',
'I\'m sure he can\'t wait to get his hands on them.',
'Hey, got any more goodies in there?  ',
'I don\'t know. Phillip signed everything so fast, I couldn\'t see.  Listen, I got to hurry.',
'Ah, you got time for this.',
'You bet I do. Later.',
'I ought to say \"thank you.\" So I will. Thank you.',
'For what?',
'Calling off the Zach war. As weird as it is to think, let alone say,  you might just be the most reasonable Spaulding out there.',
'That\'s a frightening thought. Don\'t worry, Buzz. I\'ll do  something to annoy you. That\'s what I do best. ( Laughs )',
'Well?  ',
'Well, it\'s just as I thought. You\'re very early on-- mid- first trimester, if that. So the sonogram really doesn\'t tell us much of  anything.',
'Like who the father is.',
'No, it takes a blood test or a D.N.A. Test to establish  paternity. And we can\'t do that until it\'s safe to do amniocentesis, and  that\'s at 17 weeks or so.',
'Oh, that\'s something to look forward to.',
'Look, Olivia, I know this is a very difficult situation for  you.',
'Yeah, no, it\'s not easily resolvable like dashing off a memo or  rewriting an estimate.',
'Yes, but it wouldn\'t hurt to have a strategy.  ',
'This is where you ask me whether I want to go through with the  pregnancy or not. It\'s the million dollar question.',
'How about some counseling? If you\'d like that, I...',
'No, you know what? I can... I\'m sure you can refer me to  somebody really wonderful, but I think I need to figure this out on my  own.',
'Olivia, look, if you knew who the father is, now, would  that influence your decision?',
'( Sighs ) I don\'t know.',
'Oh.',
'Thank you. I got to go. ',
'Hey, pop, excuse me one second?',
'Yeah?',
'Where did Marina go?',
'Uh... Something about studying for a test. Don\'t worry, Ben had  to get back to work.  ',
'All right, well... You know what?',
'No?',
'I\'m going to take your advice. I\'m going to give her a little  space, and hopefully she won\'t let me down.',
'Well, very good, Frank. Listen, you want to tell me why you  were asking about Holly?',
'I wish I could.',
'Frank, is she in trouble?',
'You\'re scaring me, Frank.',
'Well, I mean, seriously. I mean, look what happened with  Harley, that whole Zach situation. Talk about something good coming out  of something bad.',
'Yeah, well, who cares about Phillip? As long as Harley gets her  son back.',
'You\'re right. To Phillip.',
'To Phillip.',
'For finally realizing that Zach belongs with his mother.',
'( Scoffs ) to Phillip.',
'To Phillip.',
'Got those papers signed for you, Mr. Spaulding. It didn\'t take too  long, did it?',
'Good. You can go now.  ',
'Where is that proxy? Ah, here it is.',
'Sorry.',
'Oh, excuse me.',
'No, it\'s all right.',
'I\'m so sorry.',
'It\'s all right. You\'re a little preoccupied. I know how that can  be.',
'Did you just have a baby?',
'No, no, not... Not yet.',
'We can\'t take our eyes off this little guy.',
'Well, I can see why. He\'s, um... He\'s beautiful. He\'s very  beautiful. What\'s his name?  ',
'Simon. ( Baby cries )',
'Oh. It\'s okay. Hello, Simon. Shhh. It\'s okay.',
'He\'s our first.',
'He was named after my dad.',
'Well, congratulations, and good luck.',
'You, too.',
'Thanks. ( Baby cries ) I could use a little.',
'Hello, Olivia.',
'Are you angry with me?',
'Why?',
'You were pretty quiet in the car.',
'Well, I just feel like I lost a friend over nothing.',
'Reva, if Holly did this...',
'If. But we still don\'t have any facts to prove it.',
'Feels like there\'s more questions now then there were before.',
'Yeah, and all the other newspapers and television stations are  going to have a field day with this.',
'Reva, it might get ugly for a while for Holly, but if she\'s  innocent, she\'ll be fine.',
'After all the agony that she\'s been through, having that all  dredged up again? She won\'t be fine. And I won\'t feel so good about this  myself.  ',
'Because if Holly is innocent that means this person is still out  there somewhere.',
'We\'re going to track this person down. We\'re going to stop them.',
'How? When? I\'m sorry. I know this isn\'t your fault.',
'It\'s not your fault either.',
'Uh, yes. Yes, all right. Good-bye.',
'Is that another reporter?',
'I wish. Malcolm Holmes, chairman of the board. Heard about  the incident on the radio and wants to set up a meeting so I can explain  myself.',
'You know, you don\'t have to say anything about your past.',
'I may have to.',
'Holly, you hang in there. You did not do this. I know that, and  I\'m going to stand by you until your name is cleared, and it will happen. I  promise you that.',
'Okay. Well, I\'d better get back to the office while I still have  one.',
'Of course you do. Listen, mom, why don\'t I come with you?  ',
'Why? To keep me company, or to be my witness in case anyone  doubts I walked the two blocks myself?',
'Mom...',
'Thank you, both of you.',
'Take care. Well, this. This is truly a nightmare, isn\'t it?',
'Of the recurring variety, yeah.',
'Mom might be drinking.',
'Why do you say that?',
'She was in here, Ross, and she headed straight for the bar. I saw  her.  ',
'But she didn\'t take a drink, did she?',
'I caught her by surprise, so no, she didn\'t. And she denied that  she would have. But what if she did? What if she were by herself later on  and she did?',
'And then what did she do? She took Reva\'s dry-cleaning and did  all that stuff in a blackout?',
'Well, what if she slipped, Ross? She\'s under so much stress  right now. She\'s an alcoholic, and she\'s human.',
'I hope to God you\'re wrong about this.',
'Well, I was hoping I would find you here. How\'s Zach coming  along?',
'What\'s the matter, dad? Is there a problem with one of the  papers I signed, or should I say was supposed to sign?',
'Phillip, there was a mistake made.',
'Yeah, yeah, I know. Trying to get me to sign away my voting  rights for the next board meeting? That would have to be an accident,  right?',
'That proxy was never supposed to be in with those papers.',
'I believe you. I just... I can\'t figure out, how would that  happen?',
'I intended on discussing the issue with you personally.',
'Because you would never do anything sleazy like that.  ',
'Look, I can understand how you would take this the wrong way,  but if you will hear me out, I will explain everything to you.',
'It\'s always lovely to see you, Alexandra.',
'And were you here visiting Zach?',
'Why else would I be here?',
'Well, that\'s my next big question, because you weren\'t in  his room.  ',
'How do you know?',
'Because I was. And I just saw you come out of the cubicle  with Dr. Sedwick, in fact.',
'So what? So I... I like to take care of my health.',
'Oh, well, Dr. Sedwick\'s an obstetrician, isn\'t she? Are you  also trying to get pregnant?',
'That\'s not really high on my list of things to do.',
'My God, you\'re pregnant now, aren\'t you?',
'No, I\'m not.',
'No, you are. It all fits now. Dr. Sedwick, cooing over a  brand-new baby. You\'re pregnant, damn you.',
'Hey, what\'re the options back there? ',
'Well, you can have any kind of soup you want -- as long as it\'s  clam chowder or clam chowder. ',
'Do we at least have those little cracker dealies that go along  with them? ',
'Yes. \"Best if used by march of \'98.\" ',
'Look, next time you kidnap someone, will you be a little more  prepared? ',
'I didn\'t know we were going to get snowed in. What\'re you  doing? ',
'Looking for Bridget\'s cell phone number. See if she can stay  with the kids. ',
'Why don\'t you just call your mom? ',
'310 -- ',
'Hey, I really appreciate you being on time. Thanks a lot, man. I\'ll  see ya next week. ',
'Hey, Ceej. ',
'Hello. Wow, you look great. ',
'Thank you. Well, I had to guess what to wear, since you  wouldn\'t tell me where we\'re going for dinner. ',
'Well, you see, it\'s got to be a surprise. Otherwise, your other  boyfriend might track us down. ',
'Mark? ',
'Ah, no, Massimo. ',
'That joke will never be funny. ',
'Well, maybe I\'d quit telling it, if you would tell me why he keeps  hanging around all the time. ',
'I told you. He\'s worried about Ridge. You ready to go? Let\'s  go. ',
'Yep, I am. ',
'Is that me, or is that you? ',
'I think that\'s me. Yeah. From the cabin. Hello? ',
'Hey, Princess. ',
'Ridge? ',
'Hey, listen, I need a favor. I\'m up at the cabin right now, and  I\'m very snowed in -- ',
'And you want me to watch the kids. ',
'I know you got a life of your own, and I know you probably  had plans -- ',
'Yeah, I do. ',
'This is the first night I\'ve been away from them since their mom  died. ',
'Okay. ',
'Seriously? ',
'Yeah. I mean, I don\'t want them to get scared. ',
'Thank you so much. ',
'Sure. Ridge, what are you doing up at the cabin anyway? ',
'Oh, maybe I should let your mom explain that one. It was her  bright idea anyway. ',
'My mom\'s up there with you? ',
'Yeah. You want to talk to her? ',
'No, that\'s okay. I should go get the kids anyway. They\'re at  the after-school program, right? ',
'Yeah. Thank you, again. I owe you big time. ',
'Yeah, you do. I\'m so sorry. ',
'You know what? It\'s totally cool. I understand family does come  first. So, your mom is up at the cabin with Ridge? ',
'Yeah. ',
'Things are moving pretty quick there, don\'t you think? ',
'I guess so. I should go. Sorry, again. ',
'Hey, hey, hey, not so fast. Come here. ',
'I\'ll call you. ',
'You\'d better.   ',
'Oh, dad, I thought you left. ',
'Not without kissing the bride. Your bags are all loaded.  Lorenzo just went to put some gas in the car. ',
'The hotel you booked us into looks beautiful. ',
'Aw, honey, I wish I could\'ve given you a better honeymoon --  better wedding. ',
'No, it was beautiful. ',
'But you wish your mother was here. ',
'Lorenzo\'s my husband now. She doesn\'t even know him. ',
'Maybe someday. ',
'Yeah. Someday. ',
'Sally, you hear me? Okay, this is gonna keep you warm. ',
'Hey, Sal, I need your signature -- oh, my God! Clarke, what  happened? ',
'She just collapsed! ',
'Sally, Sally -- well, did you call 911? ',
'Of course I did. ',
'Well, God, where are they?! ',
'They\'re on their way! ',
'In here, this way, this way. They\'re here. They\'re here. They\'re  here. ',
'Step aside. Step aside. ',
'Oh, my God. Oh, my God. ',
'She\'s breathing. ',
'Oh, my God. ',
'Weak pulse. Get the EKG leads on. Was anyone with  her? ',
'Yes, he and I were. ',
'We were. ',
'She clutched her chest, and then she collapsed to the ground. ',
'She was in a lot of pain. ',
'S.T. Elevations in lead two, possible M.I. ',
'Does she have a history of heart problems? ',
'No, no, nothing, nothing. ',
'Let\'s get her in the unit. ',
'All right, we\'ll start an I.V. En route. ',
'Okay, Thorne, you and I will go with the ambulance to the  hospital. Darla, I need you to call C.J. And to meet us at the hospital. ',
'All right, all right. Don\'t leave her. Don\'t leave her alone for a  minute. Do you hear me? ',
'Get ahold of C.J. ',
'I will, I will. Hang in there, Sal. Hang in there, sweetheart. ',
'Ah, here she is. ',
'Female, unconscious. ',
'I know the patient. Where do we stand? ',
'What\'s her level of consciousness? ',
'Responding only to painful stimuli. ',
'Sally? Sally, it\'s Mark Maclaine. Can you tell me where it hurts? ',
'All right, get her to ICU now! Go, go! Another fluid bolus, we  need a portable chest x-Ray, a twelve-lead EKG. I want a cbc, cpk,  troponin -- get Dr. Cooper! ',
'How is she? ',
'She had a heart attack. ',
'Is she gonna be okay? ',
'You guys must be starving, huh? ',
'Not really. ',
'Is daddy hurt? ',
'No, no, sweetie, I told you. He\'s just stuck in the snow. ',
'All alone? ',
'No, my mom\'s up there with him. ',
'Figures. ',
'Why\'d he have to go?  ',
'He didn\'t have to. He wanted to. ',
'She used to make something he didn\'t like for dinner. ',
'Like what? ',
'Macaroni and cheese. ',
'Franks \'n\' beans. ',
'Your dad doesn\'t like franks \'n\' beans? He must be crazy! I  love \'em! ',
'Me, too. ',
'Okay, okay. So that\'s what were gonna make. But I\'m gonna  need your help, because I\'m a really terrible cook. ',
'Yeah, we know. ',
'Oh, yeah? ',
'Yeah. ',
'Yeah, says the grand master chef himself. You think you  could do so much better? ',
'Anybody could. ',
'Oh, you are getting more and more like your dad every day,  you know that? You just like giving me a hard time. ',
'No, I mean it. You can\'t cook. ',
'Come here. Come here. Yeah, get out of here you little  stinkers.    ',
'Here we are! ',
'Look at this. Such service. ',
'Yes. Well, it\'s the least I could do. You\'re stranded up here,  and it ',
'Well, if it wasn\'t for the kids -- ',
'I know. I\'m missing hope, too. But she\'s in good hands, and so  are yours. ',
'Bridget\'s being such a sweetheart. ',
'Yeah, she is. So can we stop thinking about the kids and  worrying about them, \'cause they\'re fine. Let\'s focus on the bright side,  okay? ',
'The bright side? ',
'I\'m sure if you think real hard, you could come up with  something. ',
'I don\'t know. You and I, up here all by ourselves, roaring fire,  no one to bother us. I\'m -- I\'m drawing a blank. ',
'Right. ',
'You know you made the right decision, don\'t you? ',
'Don\'t ask me that, dad. My head is spinning. ',
'I know, honey, I know. Everything happened very quickly. ',
'I do wish I could\'ve at least talked to her. ',
'I know what she would\'ve said. ',
'Do you? ',
'She would have said, \"My baby finally got what she deserves.\" ',
'But, dad, she has no idea where I am or how I\'m doing. She\'s  probably worried sick. ',
'Her vitals are stable now.  ',
'So Macy\'s alive? ',
'Yeah. ',
'She\'s not coming back? Sally may never see her again? ',
'We tried to convince her. ',
'No wonder.  No wonder.   ',
'No one can find out about this. Understand?   ',
'Dad! Is mom okay?     ',
'Yeah. She\'s in there now. We don\'t know -- ',
'What? ',
'We\'re waiting to hear. She had a heart attack. ',
'Were you with her? ',
'We both were. ',
'What did you do? Huh? Were you arguing with her?  Is that what  happened? ',
'We were talking. ',
'No, I know, dad. They were talking about Macy. What? It\'s bad  enough you killed my sister, now you\'re after my mother, too? ',
'Take it easy, take it easy. Mark -- how is she?          ',
'What are you doing? ',
'Just making up your bed. ',
'So, what, am I sleeping out here tonight? ',
'Well, I would offer to sleep on the sofa, but I know you.  You\'re too much of a gentleman to let me do that. ',
'A gentleman? ',
'Good night. ',
'You\'re going to bed now? ',
'Yeah, I\'m tired. Whipping your butt really took it out of me.    ',
'Yeah, right. whatever. Good night.  See you in the morning.   ',
'Aren\'t you at least gonna give me a kiss good night? ',
'Oh, I\'m far too much of a gentleman to do something like that. ',
'Well, Lucky for you -- I\'m not too much of a gentleman.  ',
'Oh, mom -- I wish things could be different. I really do. But  we\'ve both just got to go on the best we can. You\'ll be fine. I know you  will. ',
'Sally\'s in critical condition. ',
'So it was a heart attack? ',
'I\'ll let Dr. Cooper, our chief cardiologist, explain. ',
'Well, we did an arteriogram and discovered significant  blockage in two of the main blood vessels. I performed an immediate  angioplasty, but we\'ll -- ',
'Whoa, which is what? ',
'You think that should solve the problem? ',
'We hope so. ',
'You hope so? ',
'Are -- are you telling me that she could still die? ',
'We\'re going to do everything we can to make sure that doesn\'t  happen, okay? ',
'Hello. ',
'Mom. ',
'Oh, honey. Is everything okay? ',
'Yeah, everything\'s fine. Kids are just getting ready for bed,  but they wanted to call their dad and say good night. ',
'Oh, sure. I\'ll get him. Let me just throw something on, okay? ',
'Is that daddy? Is that daddy? ',
'I want to talk to him. ',
'Okay, hold on a sec, all right? Why don\'t you sit on the  couch? [ Knock on door ] ',
'Nice outfit. ',
'Shh -- it\'s the kids. ',
'Hey, gang. ',
'Oh, hold on, it\'s still just me. I\'m gonna put you on speaker,  okay? Go ahead. ',
'Hi, dad. ',
'Hey, sweetheart. Who\'s there now? ',
'All of us. ',
'Oh, yeah? What you been doin\'? ',
'We made franks \'n\' beans for dinner. ',
'Oh, that\'s so sweet. That\'s just like mommy would\'ve done. So  you guys are having fun? ',
'Yeah, but we miss you a lot. ',
'I miss you, too. Thomas, are you there? ',
'Yeah. ',
'How you doing, buddy? ',
'Fine. ',
'Okay, dad. Good night. ',
'Okay, daddy. Good night, I love you.   ',
'Night-night.   Love you, too. ',
'Night, dad.   ',
'Hey, Bridget -- ',
'Yeah, hold on. I\'m here. ',
'I just wanted to thank you again. ',
'No problem. Actually, is my mom there? Could I talk to her  for a sec? ',
'Yeah, yeah. Hold on. ',
'Hi. ',
'Hey. Look, I know this is none of my business -- ',
'What? What\'s going on? ',
'I would just hate to see you rush things with Ridge. ',
'Bridget, I can\'t really talk right now.   ',
'What was that all about? ',
'Nothing. All right, see you in the morning. ',
'You\'re just gonna boot me out of here, huh? ',
'Ridge, we have to be smart about this. ',
'Why? ',
'Because. ',
'Because why? You know you don\'t want me to go. ',
'No. I don\'t want you to go, but it -- that doesn\'t mean-- ',
'But what? No. ',
'Ridge -- ',
'Shh. ',
'Ridge? ',
'Hmm-mm. Hmm-mm. ',
'Hope\'s daddy? You\'re drunk!',
'Oh, I bet right about now, you\'re wishing to hell I was.',
'Just get out! Now!',
'Brooke! Brooke, I\'m sorry! I -- I know I promised. But I can\'t just  stand here and watch you fall into the same trap, not when I love you so  much!',
'What\'s the matter?',
'What is that?',
'It\'s your tape.',
'Give it to me! Give it -- where\'d you get this?',
'I have to go.',
'What are you talking about -- hey! Hey!',
'No, no! You cannot have this tape!',
'What are you talking about? It\'s mine!',
'All right. All right. How much? How much do you want for it?',
'Get your own copy!',
'I need to have that tape!',
'All right, all right. Maybe we can work something out. You know,  like a trade. For -- services rendered?',
'Jimmy, come here.',
'Well, I was thinking we could go out to my car, but --',
'Just come here. Pig!  ',
'You owe me -- $19.95! Plus tax!',
'I got your message. Something\'s wrong?',
'Do they include Brooke?',
'He\'s gonna give her a ring. Tonight.',
'He\'s proposing?',
'No. It\'s not a proposal. It\'s not an engagement. It\'s just a -- well, it\'s a  commitment.',
'Damn it.  ',
'Well, get it all out of your system now. Because when you and I go  over there --',
'What are you talking about?!',
'To congratulate them.',
'I\'m not going over there!',
'Stephanie, our son is gonna marry Brooke, and you\'re gonna have to  accept it. And there\'s nothing you or anyone else can do to keep that from  happening.',
'You sick bastard!',
'Brooke, I am so sorry. I tried, you know I did. But I cannot stand  by and watch you just fall into the same trap!',
'The same trap? That\'d be me?',
'Oh, come on, man! You\'re using her, just like you have a million  times before. But you know what the amazing thing is? I bet you don\'t even  know it!  ',
'Deacon, just get out of here!',
'Don\'t worry, Brooke. He can\'t hurt you.',
'Hurt?! I\'m -- I\'m trying to help you!',
'No, you want revenge!',
'No!',
'Yes, you do! You\'re trying to punish me!',
'Brooke, listen to me --',
'You blame me!',
'Brooke, listen to me, please! No, I don\'t! You couldn\'t be further  from the truth.  ',
'Look, if you care so much, why don\'t you walk out that door and  never come back? And leave me the hell alone!',
'So what? This is your idea of love? No wonder you think he\'s so  hung up on you! Listen to me! He has left you before. And he\'s gonna do it  again. Tonight!',
'Why would you supp',
'How can you not? When you see what Brooke has done for Ridge?',
'All she\'s done is take advantage of his grief.',
'Well, that\'s not the way I look at it. And it\'s not the way Ridge sees it  either.  ',
'Well, you two never do.',
'I\'m the only one that ever sees what Brooke is really capable of.',
'Well, if you\'re talking about Deacon -- I know all about it.',
'You know what?',
'You should have been the one to tell me. Instead, I heard it from  Brooke. She told me about Deacon. And about the baby.',
'She told you that she slept with your daughter\'s husband and he  is the father of her child?',
'Yes.',
'And this is the kind of woman that you want Ridge to be  married to?',
'She\'s learned her lesson. Stephanie, you\'re the one who\'s been telling  me over and over again how much she\'s changed!  ',
'She\'s obsessed! Nothing\'s changed!',
'Where you see obsession, I see devotion.',
'You\'re not going to say a word!',
'One word from me and Ridge would be safe -- saved!',
'Saved from the woman he loves.',
'Stephanie, there\'s no reason for him ever to find out what Brooke did.',
'He already has.',
'What?',
'He\'s here. He\'s here in L.A. And he knows about Ridge and Brooke.',
'Oh, God! Oh, God! All this ugliness is going to come crashing  down on my son.',
'Deacon, please stop this. I\'m begging you.',
'Don\'t give him the satisfaction, Brooke. He\'ll be out of our hair  soon enough. Lieutenant baker, please.',
'Oh, great. Is this how you want it to go down? In front of the  cops? In his house? With his kids here? Brooke, do something. Tell him. Go!  Tell him!  ',
'Now you want Brooke to keep you out of jail? That\'s very funny.',
'Ridge, hang up.',
'What?',
'Just -- hang up!',
'Logan, what\'re you doing?',
'I think your little Logan has something to tell you, don\'t you?',
'How could you do this to me?',
'Brooke, I\'m doing this for you.',
'What the hell is going on?',
'Go ahead.',
'Ridge, this doesn\'t have anything to do with you and me.',
'What doesn\'t?',
'It was just a mistake. A horrible mistake I made a long time ago - ',
'Great! This is -- this is great. I can see where this is going  already!',
'Will you just shut up!',
'You\'re gonna put your own little spin on it!',
'Shut up!',
'No! No! This is your big chance, Brooke! Prove me wrong! Let\'s  see me how much Ridge loves you, really accepts you for who you really are.',
'This is not about who I am right now! I\'ve changed. I\'m different!  I\'ve learned and I have grown from that! You know, Ridge. You told me. You  saw it.',
'All right. Let\'s -- just tell me what the hell this is all about. Okay?  And what it has to do with this guy.  ',
'Okay, let me -- um -- I\'m gonna try and break this down for you.',
'You break it down for me.',
'This guy? Well, this guy is actually the \"mistake.\" Brooke and I  were lovers.',
'Oh, yeah.',
'That\'s it? \"Oh, yeah?\" The first of your new line under production  and -- \"oh, yeah?\"',
'Um -- tell Josh that I think they look terrific. And, um -- I\'m just,  um -- got a lot on my mind.  ',
'Amber, are you okay?',
'I -- I\'m -- a headache? But I\'ll be fine. I just -- I need to take some  aspirin and lay down.',
'Well, here, is it here in your purse?',
'No, no, no, no, no! Really. Really. I\'m okay. I\'m okay. I -- um -- I  just need a few minutes.  ',
'All right. Okay. I\'ll check in on you before I leave. Hope you feel  better. Come on, girls. Let\'s go.',
'You\'re lying.',
'Ridge, this has nothing to do with us.',
'You and Deacon?',
'Kind of blows your mind, doesn\'t it?',
'Oh, God! Just get out of here!',
'Stop it!',
'Oh -- oh, I\'m sorry. Is it because he\'s so much above me? See,  what you\'re forgetting is, I\'ve had the real you. Not some phony act.',
'He just wants to hurt you, Ridge! He\'s jealous, because I love you  and not him! But what we had was nothing! It was all about loneliness and  need.',
'Oh, oh -- you mean kind of like you guys.',
'You can\'t even begin to understand what Ridge and I have!',
'Oh, no! No, Brooke! The two of you there?',
'Oh, God! No, Ridge, no! He just wanted a second chance.',
'No, by that time, she had already hooked a bigger fish.',
'It\'s been over for a long time!',
'How long?',
'It doesn\'t matter! It\'s just something that I was really ashamed of.  And I want to put it behind me!',
'Oh, I beg to differ. Not all of it.',
'Yes! All of it!',
'Oh, no, God, Brooke -- no, no, no -- no! Don\'t tell me that he\'s --  Brooke! Oh, God, no!',
'Yes.',
'Yeah, he\'s Hope\'s father.',
'Rudy?! Rudy! Oh -- that son of a bitch!',
'Delight Productions.',
'I want Rudy!',
'Don\'t we all?',
'Put him on the phone!',
'Look, if you\'d like me to leave a message for Mr. Delight, I could  certainly put you --',
'This is Amber Forrester! Okay?! And I want to talk to him right  friggin\' now!  ',
'Oh. Ms. Forrester. One moment, please.',
'Amber, baby. Been waiting for this call. How\'s my little star doing?',
'Do you think that I would -- do you think I could live with her  raising Taylor\'s children?  ',
'You\'re going to do more than live with it. You\'re going over there  with me tonight and you\'re gonna give them our blessing.',
'Oh, no! No! No!',
'Ridge, please tell me that this is starting to fall into place for you  here.',
'Ridge, please try to understand. I was so ashamed. I didn\'t want  anyone to know that that was Deacon\'s baby. Not even him!  ',
'You lied to Whip?',
'No.',
'Please! She never even slept with that idiot! Come on, that whole  thing was like a -- business arrangement or something.',
'You married him!',
'I didn\'t feel like I had any other choice.',
'Because she didn\'t want the secret to get out, especially to  Bridget.',
'Bridget! Oh, God, Bridget! Brooke, no! Come on! Your -- your  daughter\'s husband? Your daughter\'s husband?  ',
'Go ahead. Tell him.',
'No! Tell me I\'ve got it all wrong. Tell me you didn\'t really do that  to Bridget. Huh? Tell me it\'s not true! Tell me that you wouldn\'t do that,  Brooke!',
'Oh, watch out for that lady getting out of her car.  Just don\'t get  too close.  Nice job.  ',
'You seem nervous.  ',
'Me?  No.  Okay, yeah.  When I said I\'d give you a driving sson, I  figured it would be during the daytime.  ',
'Well, even so, let\'s just wrap this up pretty soon, okay?  ',
'There\'s hardly any traffic.  Doesn\'t that make it easier to learn? ',
'All right.  Ten more minutes, but that\'s it.  ',
'Okay.  Can I tell you something private?  ',
'Yes, as long as you keep your eyes on the road.  ',
'You don\'t have to explain to me.  I know her.  ',
'Good for you.  That took guts. ',
'The incredible thing is that she accepted it-you know, not without  a fight, of course.  ',
'Of course.  ',
'But in the end, because she knew I wouldn\'t back down.  ',
'Well, standing up for what you believe in is always the best way to  go I say.  In fact, I have a wedding ring to prove it.  ',
'What do you think dad will say?  ',
'About you moving back in?  He\'ll be so excited.  About you  learning to drive?  I wouldn\'t mention it until you get a permit.  ',
'A permit?  Do I really need one of those?  ',
'Yes, of course.  It\'s the law.  ',
'Not in Montega.  Besides, by the time I apply for one, I\'ll be an  expert driver. ',
'Oh, I think I just went through a stop sign.  What should I do?  ',
'Uh - driving is like life, Lucy.  When you make a mistake, you  smile, apologize and get the hell out of there fast.  Go.  Go!  ',
'So I suppose congratulations are in order.  You two do make a  striking couple.  ',
'My badge, Craig.  ',
'Was this like a spontaneous thing?  Or have you two been carrying  on in secret?  ',
'Mitzi is my house guest.  That\'s it.  ',
'And I resent your suggestions to the contrary. ',
'Yes, of course you do, but there\'s no need to be self-conscious  here.  We\'re all adults, and I support your need to be together.  ',
'My badge while I still have some patience left.  ',
'All right, here, but you might considering polishing it.  ',
'You really don\'t know that I can have you arrested for this?  ',
'You see the ingratitude here, Mitzi?  I get myself entombed in a  coffin, I bring back key information for my partner, and what do I get but  threats?  ',
'You\'re breaking my heart.  ',
'Do you realize that you\'ve contaminated the one piece of evidence  that Stenbeck left behind?  Forensics could use that coffin to put us on his  trail. ',
'We are on his trail, Jack, and who\'s the boy scout who got it?  ',
'The pilot?  Whatever he said is hearsay.  ',
'Are you aware that Barbara speaks French?  ',
'Yes, yes.  Having an office in paris for so many years, of course.  ',
'Maybe.  ',
'Don\'t you think that is a lead worth pursuing considering that if  we find where the coffins went, we\'d probably find Carly as well?  ',
'I\'ll check into it. ',
'It\'s called \"synergy,\" Jack.  I do the leg work.  You do the follow- up.  ',
'You\'re interfering with police business, Montgomery.  If you don\'t  cut it out -',
'Oh, quit bellyaching, Jack.  I\'m your partner.  You might as well  get used to it.',
'Hi, sweetie.  It\'s Kim.  Go for the chocolate.  ',
'Hi.  It\'s John.  Go for both.  And I\'m thinking about you.  ',
'I\'ve got to deal with some unruly customers, Barbara.  So just give  me a call, darling.  The number\'s right there by the phone.  Bye.  ',
'Messages  deleted.  ',
'I\'ve got to get out of here.  ',
'Running away again?  Haven\'t you realized that\'s not  a solution?  ',
'Are you stalking me?  ',
'You shouldn\'t be so surprised.  We\'re the same  person, Barbara.  ',
'No we\'re not.  You don\'t exist anymore.  ',
'I could if you\'d let me.  ',
'It\'s too late.  I\'ve changed too much.  ',
'You can change again.  It happens all the time.  ',
'I can\'t do that.  I\'ve fallen too far.  ',
'I can pick you up.  I can walk beside you until you  can walk alone again.  Nothing\'s impossible if you give it a chance. ',
'You know, I think maybe one of us should go over and check your  apartment.  ',
'Why?  ',
'Well, because she didn\'t pick up.  Who knows what\'s going on.  ',
'Well, I know.  She probably fell asleep watching an old movie or  something.  ',
'Yeah, but she was sleeping the last time you called, too.  ',
'Well, look, she is so tired, and she needs her rest.  Nothing wrong  with having a little sleep, right?  ',
'No, no, no.  Nothing wrong at all as long as it\'s not medication  involved.  I think we\'ve done away with all that she was stockpiling.  ',
'I think what we should do is stop being so careful around her.  We  ought to act as though we trust her, encourage her.  That\'s what she needs. ',
'Well, as far as I\'m concerned, that\'s what I have been doing, and I  have no intentions of stopping.  ',
'I\'m grateful that my mother has friends and family like the three of  you.  But praising her for getting through the day is not the way to help her.  ',
'Is that a medical opinion?  Or is that your personal opinion?  ',
'She\'s not an invalid, John.  She\'s a dangerous and bitter person who  most likely kidnapped three people. ',
'Honey, your mother hasn\'t had a chance to defend herself.  And  these are very crazy charges-',
'They\'re not crazy, Aunt Kim.  Evidence proves otherwise.  ',
'Well, we have to give her the benefit of the doubt.  ',
'And does that mean that we can\'t?  ',
'If you want to help her, yeah, it does.  Instead of wrapping her up in  excuses, push her to admit what she\'s done.  ',
'Yeah, well, tell that to her victims.  And the people who love them.  ',
'Look, I know this has been very difficult for you, Paul.  But  lashing out at your mother like this is not going to help the situation.  ',
'It\'s not a \"situation.\" It\'s a living hell, and it\'s been that way for a  long time.  I mean, she\'s not only a kidnapper, she\'s a blackmailer, too.  ',
'Oh, now, please -',
'It\'s true, Lisa.  She dug up old negative information about Rose\'s  past, and used it against her to keep her away from me.  ',
'That is so silly.  I know that she would never-',
'She admitted it.  ',
'What?  Are you afraid to hear the truth, Aunt Kim?  \'Cause you\'re  afraid it\'s gonna shatter the image you have of Barbara that you keep holding  onto?  ',
'After the explosion at the boathouse, she left the house and went to  Fairwinds, abandoned all of her other children.  ',
'We know that.  We know that.  And can\'t you understand that she  probably did that because she didn\'t want Will to see her, she didn\'t want to  frighten him? ',
'Well, look, that didn\'t last forever.  You know that.  ',
'Now, you wait a minute.  There\'s been no proof of that. ',
'She was arrested for it.  And now, in the process, will is abandoned  yet again.  ',
'Well, poor little boy, what\'s happened to Will is such a tragedy.   But if we could just help Barbara, then she will help Will.  ',
'All you\'re doing is buying into her sickness.  You\'re showing more  sympathy for her than the people she hurt.  ',
'And you think we should do what?  Abandon her?  ',
'Make her take responsibility for the disappearances of Carly, Emily  and Rose.  Make her help us find them before it\'s too late.  ',
'All right now, that\'s just about enough.  It\'s a pretty big jump  between will\'s sleeping disorder and having Barbara accused of triple  murder. ',
'The police have already accused her of abduction.  All I\'m asking is  that you take it seriously.  ',
'The police already say that she\'s-they think she\'s guilty.  That\'s  what Jack said to me earlier-Jack Snyder.  ',
'And unfortunately, Jack is now working with Craig, which destroys  any credibility he might have had as far as I\'m concerned.  ',
'What\'s wrong?  ',
'Your face - I won\'t torture myself with the way things used to  be.  ',
'It might help you to move forward.  If you can look  at me without shying away, maybe you can believe in yourself again.  ',
'You\'re dead.  You died in the fire.  And you are never coming  back.  ',
'You were a happy person before then.  Remember?  ',
'No.  No, I don\'t want to look back.  ',
'Life with Hal - the feeling of being loved no matter  what happens, for better or worse.  ',
'Stop.  Please. ',
'My success as a fashion designer.  Building my own  company.  ',
'Haven\'t you noticed?  I can barely hold a pencil in this hand?  ',
'What about the children?  Watching will get that  game - winning run.  Jennifer being elected president of her class -',
'Things weren\'t always so good.  You hurt people, too.  ',
'I was imperfect.  I was human.  Good and bad,  always changing.  ',
'Do you still love to dance?  ',
'Oh, yes.  ',
'And watch the sun set until the sky turns black?  ',
'One of my favorite things.  It hurts to remember,  doesn\'t it? ',
'Oh, it hurts.  And I threw it all away.  I had everything a woman  could want, and I threw it all away.  ',
'For Craig Montgomery-a man who never loved you.  ',
'How could I have any self-respect?  I was such a fool.  ',
'You\'re right.  You were.  But maybe you\'ve suffered  enough.  Maybe it\'s time you forgive yourself.  ',
'I can\'t.  I\'m too ashamed.  ',
'I\'m warning you, Craig.  Get the hell out of here, or I\'m gonna kick  you out.  ',
'With which leg, Jack?  ',
'I\'m gonna break my good foot off of you -',
'Jack!  Jack!  Are you all right? ',
'I\'m fine.  Really.  Mitzi, maybe it\'s best if you go upstairs.  ',
'You sure?  ',
'Yeah.  Yeah, I don\'t want you a part of this.  ',
'Okay - take care of business.  ',
'You weren\'t good, Montgomery, you were lucky.  ',
'Oh, really, Jack?  Have you forgotten so soon about that staircase I  lifted off your leg?  ',
'Right?  ',
'No.  No, I haven\'t forgotten.  No one has forgotten.  ',
'All right, well, then let us stop bickering and find Carly, okay?   Even Batman and Robin didn\'t agree on everything.  ',
'You are not a cop!  ',
'You know, law enforcement is not as difficult as you make it out  to be.  ',
'Oh, really?  ',
'Oh, yeah.  You talk tough.  But you ask a few pertinent questions.   You memorize the Miranda Acts, slap the cuffs on, Bob\'s your uncle. ',
'Oh, it\'s that easy, is it?  I\'ll bet you couldn\'t even pass the handcuff  test.  ',
'What is it?  20 questions on which way to turn the key?  ',
'No, you put the handcuffs on, and then you open them with a key  within ten seconds.  ',
'Well, no wonder we\'re not getting crimes solved, because all our  public servants are out doing parlor games to amuse themselves.  ',
'Care to give it a shot?  ',
'Jack, our time is too valuable -',
'Well, what\'s the matter, Craig?  You scared?  ',
'No.  But I happen to think that handcuffs are kind of a right place,  right time kind of thing. ',
'Well, here they are.  It\'s your call.  ',
'All right.  Usually, I get to buy dinner first.  ',
'See, it\'s not as easy as it looks, now, is it?  ',
'There you go.  All right?  Do you have the key?  ',
'Why yes, I do.  ',
'Can I have it, please?  \'Cause you\'re not my type, and I don\'t want  to spend the whole evening like this.  ',
'Well, see, your plans have just changed.  You\'re under arrest for  impersonating an officer.  ',
'Knowing the truth about my mother breaks my heart.  But at least  I\'m not hiding behind excuses about how rough she\'s had it.  ',
'Rough?  Rough does not begin to describe what your mother has  been through, what her life is like.  You know the physical agony, the pain -',
'John?  John?  ',
'Yeah, heard all about it.  ',
'This is just not productive.  ',
'You\'re absolutely right!  ',
'Honey, you heard Jack interrogate your mother.  She showed  absolutely no knowledge that Stenbeck had been transporting people out of  town -',
'That\'s not proof.  ',
'-- In a coffin.  ',
'That\'s not proof that she wasn\'t involved in other phases of the  operation.  ',
'Listen to me.  We all know Barbara pretty well up here.  She\'s done  some crazy things, but she would not do something like that.  ',
'Well, the person you know and love doesn\'t exist anymore.  And all  the hugs in the world will not change that.  ',
'I\'m sorry Paul, we\'re gonna have to do this our way.  ',
'Oh.  And sacrifice three or four other human beings in the process?   How do you justify that, John? ',
'Oh, I don\'t think we\'re doing that.  ',
'Excuse me.  ',
'Not so fast.  I heard what you just said about your mother.  ',
'And what, you think I\'m an awful son, too, right?  Well, can\'t  please everybody, can I?  ',
'Hold it.  I happen to agree with you.  ',
'You made a mistake.  Everyone makes them.  ',
'But few of us are as marked by them as I have been.  I see my  mistake every day of my life, my stupidity - my loss.  ',
'There\'s more to you than that, Barbara.  You\'re  everything that I am, too.  ',
'Not anymore.  ',
'Yes, still.  And we belong together.  ',
'It\'s not that simple.  I don\'t know how to be you anymore.  ',
'I can show you.  I can teach you.  ',
'You don\'t know what you\'re saying.  How can this ever be that  again? ',
'Anything is possible, if you\'re willing to give it a  chance.  ',
'And why should I bother?  Because you\'re beautiful?  That\'s  over.  And I\'ve accepted it.  I\'m rid of you.  And I never want you back  again.  ',
'But Barbara -',
'You\'re dead!  Stay that way.  ',
'All right, Jack.  You\'ve had your fun, now let me go.  ',
'Oh, the fun\'s just starting.  Wait till we get to the station.  ',
'You know, you arrest me, they\'ll find out just how much I\'ve been  helping you.  ',
'Okay.  All right.  You see these?  Now you don\'t. ',
'Hey, thanks for everything, Jack.  Let me know if I can -',
'Hey, wait a minute.  Wait a minute, Mitzi.  Where do you think  you\'re going?  ',
'Well, you know, you\'ve been real swell about me staying here and  all, but I think it\'s best if I find someplace else.  ',
'Put that suitcase down.  ',
'Why should she, Jack?  ',
'Don\'t know - I\'m not gonna let a filthy mind like Craig\'s keep me  from helping a friend.  ',
'Oh, no, don\'t stop, I think you should help -',
'Be quiet!  I invited you to say here because I want you to, and I still  do, for as long as you like.  ',
'Someone else could get the same idea he did.  ',
'Well, that\'s their problem, not ours.  I\'ll be back later, okay? ',
'You want me to put some coffee in a thermos or something?  A  nice cup of soup?  ',
'Well, thanks, but Craig and I have an appointment with a  fingerprint blotter.  I don\'t know when I\'ll get a break.  ',
'Well, I wouldn\'t want to keep you from that.  ',
'Jack, look, I got a daughter who needs me.  ',
'Well, you should have thought of that before you stole my badge.  ',
'All right.  All right.  All right.  You win, okay?  I won\'t do any  more police work unless you approve it.  ',
'Let\'s go, Craig.  ',
'Jack, you need me to follow up that lead in Marseilles. ',
'Really?  Why?  ',
'Because I speak French.  You don\'t.  ',
'Je parle francais, Jack.  ',
'Mais oui.  Feel like taking a ride?  ',
'Oui oui.  Porquoi pas?  ',
'Coming.  Coming with plenty of lovin\' to follow.  ',
'Oh, thanks.  Thanks a lot, but today you\'re not my type.  ',
'That\'s a shame.  I thought you were Katie.  ',
'Well, I was hoping that you were Lucy.  She\'s here, isn\'t she?   She\'s here?  ',
'I have no idea where anyone is right at the moment.  Sorry. ',
'Well, I was just dropping by because - her schoolbook, she left  it behind at my house.  ',
'Okay.  You can just leave it there.  I\'ll make sure she gets it.  ',
'Okay.  It\'s Latin.  Structure.  You are aware that she\'s moving in  -',
'Yes.  ',
'-- Here?  Again?  ',
'I saw her suitcase in the other room and figured she was back.  ',
'Well, things get pretty manic and exciting around here, I wouldn\'t  take it personal.  ',
'Yeah, I bet they do.  I bet they do.  It was a joy-however short- lived-to see her bright, shining morning face.  ',
'She\'s a great girl.  ',
'Yes, she is.  ',
'She\'s a really great girl.  ',
'She is.  And I don\'t understand my daughter leaving her -',
'Craig, yes.  ',
'No, no, I don\'t want to get involved, thanks.  No, I\'m not  interested, but again, thanks anyway.  ',
'Okay.  Well, ask her to call me.  And please, make sure that the  book isn\'t misplaced in this funhouse.  Because it\'s Latin and she has a test -',
'It is Latin and Latin is very important.  ',
'It is.  ',
'I will make sure she gets it.  ',
'Test next week.  ',
'I\'ll personally hand deliver it.  ',
'All right.  ',
'Whoa!  Wait, wait --- ',
'What?  ',
'Wait a second.  This might answer a couple of questions for both  of us.  It\'s fine.  Lucy is with Katie.  Katie is giving her her first driving  lesson. ',
'In the dark?  Oh, my heavens!  For heaven\'s sake!  Not one  second is she in this house and it\'s starting already.  ',
'Am I going too fast?  ',
'Why don\'t you check the speedometer?  ',
'I can\'t.  ',
'22 miles an hour.  ',
'Should I speed up?  ',
'No, no.  This is fine.  Ready to head home?  ',
'Five more minutes?  Please?  Please, please, please.  ',
'Okay.  Okay, let\'s practice our left hand turns.  Turn left at the  next street.  ',
'Okay -',
'Don\'t forget your turn signal.  You have to be courteous to the  drivers behind you.  Both hands on the wheel, slowing down - very nice. ',
'Doesn\'t that sign mean it\'s a one-way?  ',
'Yes, actually, it does.  That way.  ',
'What should I do?  ',
'Uh - turn at the next curb, pull over and I\'ll drive.  ',
'Which one?  ',
'I don\'t know.  I\'d have to figure out - oh, no.  No, no, no!  It\'s a  cop.  ',
'Are they going to arrest me?  ',
'Yeah, probably, and me, too.  Pull into the next driveway.  ',
'The one with the open garage?  ',
'Yes, perfect.  Pull in, turn off the lights, and I\'ll shut the door from  behind. ',
'But isn\'t that against the law?  ',
'No.  We\'ll be fine.  I\'ve seen it on TV a million times.  ',
'If you say so -',
'No, not the turn signal, Lucy!  We\'re trying to get away from  them!  ',
'But you said I should always be courteous -',
'There\'s no time to be courteous!  ',
'I\'m gonna deny everything, Jack - the badge, the coffin - I\'m  gonna force you to try and prove this in court.  ',
'Sit down here and stay quiet.  ',
'You need me, Jack.  And by the way, five\'ll get you ten Mitzi\'s  French goes -',
'I said, quiet!  ',
'Hey!  ',
'-- Not much further than s\'il vous plait.  ',
'Are you clear on what we need to know?  ',
'Yeah.  You\'re looking for two coffins flown in from Oakdale.   You want to know if James Stenbeck or Barbara Ryan arranged to have  them picked up. ',
'And if they did, where did they get sent from there?  ',
'Give me two minutes.  ',
'Two minutes.  ',
'I heard.  ',
'So, where did you learn how to speak French?  ',
'From a croupier in Atlantic City.  ',
'Oh, someone you -',
'The boss hired me to teach him English.  While I was at it, I  learned French.  ',
'I knew you were smart, but this goes above and beyond. ',
'Well, I\'ve had to be smart.  I\'ve been on my own since I was 16.  ',
'Trouble at home?  ',
'You mean was my mother a prostitute?  Did my father beat me?  ',
'It happens.  ',
'So where did you grow up?  ',
'Trenton, New Jersey.  With my aunt - who had six kids of her  own.  So when I decided to drop out of high school, not one person tried to  talk me out of it. ',
'Detective, I\'m on with a Marseilles Van Service, line six.  ',
'Okay.  You ready?  Here we go.  All set?  ',
'Yup.  ',
'Good luck.  ',
'Bon soir, monsieur.  Je m\'appelle Mitzi.  J\'espre que vous pouvez  me donner de l\'information?  ',
'Look, it goes without saying that we all love Barbara.  But she\'s   involved with Stenbeck again and she refuses to admit it.  ',
'Well, all right.  Maybe she is in some kind of denial.  But it\'s  because of what happened to her.  ',
'What happened was a boathouse blew up.  Now, that\'s tragic, but it  doesn\'t excuse everything. ',
'Thank you.  ',
'Is it all right with you if we go over and visit with her?  Or would  that somehow compromise this investigation?  ',
'I was just expressing my opinion, John.  You do what you like.  ',
'I\'m going to go over and see if she\'s sleeping.  Would you like to  come along?  ',
'Sure.  I\'ll pick up those desserts and come right along with you.   Paul, honey.  I know your mother really would like to see you, if you\'d come  along. ',
'Sorry.  ',
'Lisa dear, I\'ll come along, too.  I just want a minute with Bob.  ',
'Sure.  ',
'Thank you for your support.  ',
'I\'ll have one of those.  Cheers.  If that\'s possible.  How\'s Will?  ',
'Confused.  ',
'Jennifer?  ',
'Doing her best.  ',
'What about you?  Look, I know it\'s tough when somebody you love  makes mistakes.  You don\'t know whether to hug them or shake them. ',
'Well, people do come back from bad places.  ',
'I thought you were supposed to be on my side.  ',
'Well, believe it or not, I\'m on Barbara\'s.  I don\'t believe that  coddling her is the answer.  But I\'d hate to see you cut her off completely.  ',
'Stay away.  ',
'Barbara -',
'Stay away.  ',
'Why?  What are you afraid of?  ',
'Failure.  ',
'I don\'t understand. ',
'I\'ve disappointed too many people.  I\'ve done too many cruel  things.  Even if I tried to go back, the world wouldn\'t let me.  ',
'It\'s not up to other people.  It\'s up to you and how  much you want to change.  ',
'I don\'t have the strength.  ',
'Yes, you do.  Look at me.  ',
'Why?  ',
'I have only one goal, and there is no way you can achieve it for  me.  ',
'Give me a chance.  Tell me what it is.  ',
'Get James out of my life forever, destroy him if you have to.  ',
'Is that so impossible?  ',
'He\'s too strong, too treacherous.  ',
'You drove him away once before.  Don\'t you  remember?  You were under his spell, and you broke it to protect Paul.  ',
'I was different then.  I had purpose – control -',
'And you can be that way again, if you accept me  back into your life.  I\'m here, Barbara.  Embrace me. ',
'Please, just calm down, okay?  Listen, don\'t panic.  They\'re gonna  be walking through the door any minute.  ',
'That\'s what we said-that\'s what we said about her older brother.  ',
'Okay, wait, wait, wait.  Who are you calling?  ',
'I\'m calling the police.  To save her life, I\'ll get them both  arrested.  ',
'Don\'t do that.  That would be a mistake.  ',
'It\'s better than grieving.  ',
'She might make it to her next birthday, okay?  ',
'Hello?  Uh, yes, Miss Montgomery lives here.  This is her  grandmother speaking.  To whom am I speaking?  I see.  Tell me all about it.  ',
'Who is it?  ',
'Uh-huh.  I see.  Fine.  I\'ll see you down at the station  momentarily.  ',
'The station, okay, what happened?  ',
'Lucy and Katie have been in a car accident.  ',
'Well, was anybody hurt?  ',
'No, fortunately not.  ',
'Okay, that\'s good.  That\'s good.  Then what happened? ',
'Well, what happened was Lucy backed up and into a cops\' car.   That was Officer Shanks.  He\'s the arresting officer.  And he is not in good  spirits.  ',
'You sure you\'re okay?  No cuts, no bruises?  No sprained ankles?   Nothing?  ',
'I\'m fine.  I\'m fine, daddy.  Why are you in handcuffs?  ',
'Listen, I\'m the one asking the questions here.  Right now - and by  the way, Ms. Nascar, who are you to be giving driving lessons?  ',
'Oh, I\'m fine, too, Craig.  Thanks for asking. ',
'Good, because I want you healthy when I wring your neck.  ',
'Oh, come on!  It was a minor, minor, minor accident.  It just  happened to involve a police car.  So what is with the handcuffs?  ',
'That is not your concern.  What you should be worried about is  what happens when Lucinda finds out about this.  ',
'Lucinda\'s not gonna be a problem.  ',
'Lucinda\'s always a problem.  And if she does find out about this,  Lucy will be on the next plane back to Montega.  ',
'Well, actually, I\'m not staying with her anymore.  I moved out this  afternoon.  ',
'To where? ',
'Well, your place.  I figured you wouldn\'t mind.  ',
'Mind?  I\'m ecstatic.  ',
'German at a glance. Some big... Big help. Oh, God. Hi.',
'Hey.',
'How are the boys?',
'Yeah. Yeah, let\'s go.',
'Why not? Why not?',
'Because you can\'t. Because you\'re not even here. You didn\'t  hear five words I just said. You can\'t ignore it. It won\'t go away.',
'Look, Roy baker is a liar, okay? That\'s it. He\'s a liar.',
'Good. Then take this, get out there and prove it. Get some  answers.',
'You think you\'re smarter than me?',
'No. But I sure do save your butt sometimes, don\'t I?',
'( Sighs ) are you going to be all right with the kids?',
'I\'m going to be fine. I\'m going to pick the boys up. We\'ll be  waiting here for you when you get back.',
'All right.',
'Gus. We\'ll be waiting here for you no matter what the answer  is.',
'I know what the answer is, okay? Roy baker is a liar. There\'s no  way Miguel Santos is my father. There\'s just no way.',
'Okay, but with that small chance, the off chance that it\'s true,  you should prepare yourself. You could be part of the Santos family.',
'So this will be much better than the beacon don\'t you think?',
'Yeah. Yeah, the chef here does a great brunch. Have you and Mr.  Hendon ever tried it?',
'Oh, Ben, Mr. Hendon and I don\'t try much of anything  together.',
'I\'m sorry to hear that.',
'Oh, don\'t be. We\'re not. Honestly. We\'re both happy with the  way things are.',
'I can not believe they let us in here dressed like this.',
'Well, it\'s too cold for the patio. Besides you look great.',
'Maybe not for this room, though.',
'For any room. You\'re this choice of class.',
'Okay, so if we\'re going to party and celebrate, we should ask  Marah to join us?',
'Oh, all right.',
'Why not?',
'I\'ll give her a call. I\'m sure she\'ll...',
'You don\'t have to do that. She\'s inside.',
'Oh, really?',
'Yeah.',
'Great.',
'So I\'ll get some samples of the business cards and stationary  made up, and then I\'ll fax it to you.',
'Great. I\'m so glad.',
'Whoa, whoa.',
'Tony...',
'No. Forget it. Eden, what... What... What are you doing? Do you  know what she\'s doing, Marah?',
'Yes, Tony. And I\'m going to work for her.',
'She\'s just the talent I\'m looking for.',
'Marah, do you know what Eden\'s business is?',
'Yes, it\'s an escort service.',
'Do you know what that really means?',
'And she understands it\'s a legitimate business.',
'Look, Tony, I\'m just going to design some business cards and  stationary for her work. See? Like it?',
'Yeah, it\'s great. What are you doing, Eden? Why Marah of all  people?',
'I saw her drawings, and I was blown away. I thought she\'d be  perfect for the job.',
'Uh-huh. You see, most legitimate businesses, they hire an ad  agency. Why my girlfriend?',
'Sure. What is up with you? You don\'t think that someone  would want to hire me for my work?',
'Baby, of course I do. But not Eden august. Okay, come on. She\'s  working an angle here.',
'Okay, right. Everything is about you.',
'Okay, look, Tony, I have no illusions about this girl, okay? But  this is great practice for me.',
'You want your name and your work associated with an escort  service.',
'I don\'t know. I don\'t know, baby. This is... No. This girl\'s  trouble.',
'I have lunch with my dad. I completely forgot. I\'ll talk to you  later, okay?',
'Well, finally.',
'Yes.',
'You almost missed out. We need to get you... We need a glass  for you actually. We don\'t...',
'Hey, so, is everything okay with Marah?',
'I hope so, you know. She\'s too trusting.',
'Well, you\'re just going to have to watch out for her. Right?',
'My niece can take care of herself. She is smart. You don\'t have  to worry about her.',
'Yeah.',
'So how are things going with you and Josh these days?',
'Really good. Why?',
'Because I\'m thinking our success with fifth street is going to  depend largely on you and Josh.',
'Yes, I am ready to order.',
'I just need a few minutes please.',
'Are you all right?',
'Sure, yeah. I just... I\'m looking at this menu and it\'s more than I  bargained for. Would you mind if we went somewhere else?',
'Well, I\'m picking up the check.',
'Well, I meant the food. I mean, I\'m looking at all the sauces, and I  just really like something lighter.',
'Ben, we can have the chef make you whatever you like.  Now, help me choose wine.',
'Look, I\'m telling you, Buzz is no pushover. If he says you  have...',
'Excuse me.',
'If he says you have a golden arm then you do, and he thinks  that you can turn pro before you\'re 20.',
'That\'s true. That\'s what hurt William Epps slider.',
'You know about him?',
'I love it when you talk stats to me.',
'Oh, yeah, it\'s a real turn on, isn\'t it? All right, are you going to  buy me lunch or what? Because we need some menus.',
'Well, where are you going now?',
'I\'m going to go somebody that knows Miguel Santos very well.',
'Who I be if I didn\'t have you? Hmm?',
'You\'d be a slob with a two pack a day habit. ( Laughter )',
'We can do better than that. All right. Bye. ( Doorbell rings )',
'Hi, Harley. I bet you missed me just as much as I missed you.',
'Then you better come in, Eden.',
'Why? Do you got an ambush waiting?',
'Might feel like one. There\'s something you should know.',
'What?',
'Gus has been... Well, actually we both have been investigating  this case.',
'I don\'t care about your boring cop work.',
'I don\'t care how lame you think high school baseball is, you  have to come to the games. I think you\'d be a great coach.',
'You already have a coach.',
'Yeah, but I mean you\'ve got a good eye. I think you could  really help out.',
'You know, I always love \"la boheme,\" and that production  was just wonderful.',
'Yeah, yeah. Three hours and it felt like nothing.',
'That\'s right. You\'ve mentioned you seen it before.',
'Yeah, in London a few years ago.',
'I knew you were a man after my heart. I have to go to the  ladies room. ( Phone rings )',
'Excuse me just one second. Sorry about that. It\'s the escort  service. And I\'ll just be a minute. Sorry. Hey.',
'Ben?',
'All right, look, Marina. I know this looks sketchy, but this is  work. All right, it is a working lunch.',
'Okay, okay. Why don\'t I come over and say hi and meet your  new boss?',
'No, no. Do not do... How would that look?',
'I don\'t know. Maybe like you ran into a friend during lunch.',
'No, no. It\'s just... It\'s not a good time, all right? And what are you  doing here with Shayne?',
'We came here to play racquetball since a certain person was  too busy to hang out with me.',
'I know. I know, I\'m sorry. You guys have fun, okay? I have to  run. I\'ll talk to you later.',
'Fine.',
'Sorry about that. Where were we?',
'Waiting for our lunch. But to tell the truth, I can\'t wait for  dessert.',
'Hey, Josh.',
'Hi. How are you?',
'Good.',
'Marah, sorry to interrupt, but I have some news.',
'Okay. Well, if the two of you need a few moments together I...',
'No. Actually we don\'t. I need to speak to you. I have an  opportunity for you.',
'You know that I can talk to Josh for us.',
'Yeah, I know.',
'But you want to let Tony do it?',
'Mm-hmm. He\'s... Tony\'s been feeling he\'s doesn\'t have much  of a say in things, so... You know, everybody\'s got their individual  strengths here.',
'Yeah.',
'Yeah, what? What?',
'You\'re just a good guy? Keep the champagne cold for me.',
'Why? What... Where are you going?',
'City hall. I have to pick up some information on research and  government grants. I\'ll pick it up, and I\'ll bring it back.',
'Well, okay. Well, hurry back. I\'m going to be stuck here  celebrating all by myself.',
'You\'ll be fine. I\'ll be back.',
'Sure, help yourself, Aitoro.',
'Yeah, I think I will. Maybe we should make a little toast.',
'To what?',
'To brotherhood.',
'Just the person I\'ve been looking for.',
'Then leave a message at the desk, because I\'m in a hurry.',
'It\'s good news, Cassie. I think you want to hear this one in  person.',
'You do look way too happy.',
'I hope you\'d be happy, too, one day. Cassie, I have a new  job.',
'You? You have a job? You are working?',
'Yes, I am. I\'m San Cristobel\'s new ambassador to the united  states.',
'( Laughs ) right. What? You had that printed up on little crests?  Is that how you\'re going to worm your way into cocktail parties? Is that it?',
'Cassie, Prince William announced it yesterday. It\'s in all the  newspapers if you want to check it.',
'Richard\'s job? Alonzo gave you Richard\'s job?',
'Cassie, I have job. I know I\'ll never be able to fill his shoes.',
'You don\'t deserve to pick up his dirty socks, Edmund.',
'I have a duty, Cassie. I have a debt to pay to my country, to  Richard, and I think somewhere in all that even to myself.',
'All right, I\'m here on business, Cassie. My first duty as  ambassador involves you. And it involves Richard.',
'Tony, this is amazing. I am so proud of you.',
'It\'s fighting the good fight.',
'Yeah.',
'And I wish you the best. Really, I do.',
'Well, how about joining it?',
'What?',
'Yeah, if it works, it\'ll be great for everybody. But there\'s going to  be a lot of money flowing around, you know? A lot of labor and union  consideration.',
'It\'s not going to be a Santos operation. It\'s not like that. Not ever  again.',
'Dad, you don\'t think that Tony would lie to you, do you?',
'I\'m not making accusations, sweetheart.',
'I understand why you\'re concerned. You\'ll have to trust us.',
'Cassie\'s involved with this, right?',
'Oh, yeah. Right up front. I mean, you should see how things are  going over at towers. We\'ve been working with your guys for a while.',
'I\'ve heard. I\'ve heard things are very smooth.',
'Yeah.',
'So then why are you hesitating?',
'You think it\'s more risky than hiring Billy when he came out of  prison? Nobody was willing to give him a chance then except for you.',
'Well, actually there was two of us. There was myself and Gus  Cooper.',
'Okay, the two of you. Do you regret it?',
'All right, I\'ll bite. What kind of brotherhood are we drinking  to?',
'To ours.',
'Ours?',
'I think we\'re brothers.',
'( Laughs )',
'I know it\'s a little bit wacky, all right?',
'That... What... What makes you say that?',
'Crazy?',
'What are talking about? Well, yeah.',
'Uh-huh.',
'Yeah. Very crazy. Was that what you were doing with my  father\'s old records?',
'Yeah. It was an ongoing investigation.',
'So you\'ve been investigating this?',
'Uh-huh.',
'Um-um. Why? Should it?',
'Well, he was on your father\'s payroll for years.',
'Okay, well, you must know. You\'ve been investigating.',
'Yeah, and he was my father\'s partner.',
'Your father\'s partner was on Santos payroll?',
'No, no, no. Joe august never took a dime from my family. That  much I do know.',
'So let me get this... So you\'re the... You\'re the son of this  nanny and my father? That\'s... That\'s the story?',
'Yeah. That\'s the story, and I was hoping maybe you could tell me  that it wasn\'t true.',
'Well...',
'Sorry, I can\'t. I can\'t tell you that.',
'Yeah, nice try. You really want to get rid of me, don\'t you?',
'No, actually I don\'t.',
'And so you just make up some crazy story about...',
'Please stop. Please.',
'It\'s always been me and Nicky. And now you\'re trying to say  that... That... I mean, I\'m not his...',
'You mean my uncle Roy? My dad\'s old partner?',
'So my parents couldn\'t have kids, so am I adopted?',
'So I\'m their child and Nicky is who? I mean, who are his  parents?',
'He doesn\'t know yet. We\'re still trying to figure that out.',
'Nicky\'s not my brother?',
'Not biologically, no. Are you all right?',
'No. I mean, it\'s always been me and Nicky. I mean, especially  after my father died. And now... And now he\'s not? You know what?  Congratulations.',
'What?',
'You won. This is a dream come true for you, right?',
'Eden, Gus is totally torn up about this.',
'And now you get to put him back together now that you don\'t  have the pest of a sister in the way.',
'Wait a minute. Wait, wait.',
'No, I get it. Gus doesn\'t owe me anything anymore.',
'No, but you owe him. You owe him. Your brother... He is all  in pieces. He just found out that his whole life is a lie, Eden. He needs  you.',
'He needs me?',
'You want me to stay?',
'Yes. For Gus\' sake, yes, I do. If you love him, if you\'ve ever  loved him, please don\'t leave him now.',
'I\'m going to go check on our court, okay?',
'Mm-mm. ( Cell phone rings )',
'I am so sorry. Excuse me one more time. Yes, dear.',
'I don\'t like the way that that way that woman is touching you.  Now what can of job exactly is this?',
'I\'m never going to find out if you keep interrupting me.',
'Look, it\'s just the way she\'s looking at you. It\'s like you\'re a  hunk of meat. I just think you deserve better than that.',
'Yeah, and I also deserve a fat paycheck, neither of which I\'m  going to get if you ruin this for me.',
'Sorry. I\'m sorry. I\'m just... I\'m trying to look out for you.',
'Well, I\'m suppose to play racquetball with Shayne now.',
'Well, we\'re square it off with him and show him what\'s up on the  court. All right? Now wait for me here, okay?',
'Okay. Just make it fast, okay?',
'All right. Bye. Ramona, I am so sorry. That was my Aunt, and  she has been sick and laid up. And normally it wouldn\'t be a big deal, but I  have to go see her.',
'Right now?',
'Yes. Listen, don\'t worry about paying or whatever. I feel really  bad about having to cut this short.',
'No, really I understand. Life happens. But would you please  give me a ride back to the beacon?',
'Sure. Yeah.',
'Thank you.',
'How dare you?',
'How dare I? I though this was fitting?',
'Yes, it is. So how dare you be so horrible and so smart about  what Richard wanted and who he was?',
'You\'re raising money?',
'And you\'re in charge?',
'So I could put my stamp on it? So I could make you legit.',
'No, Cassie, to honor Richard. There\'ll be people there who  missed you, who\'d love to see you again.',
'You\'re wrong about me, Cassie. And I will prove it to you.',
'Okay, I\'ll tell you what. Why don\'t you send me what you have?  All the government grant stuff, the building plans, whatever you have. Just  send it.',
'Absolutely. I\'m right on top of it. Thank you so much.',
'And I will consider it, okay? But I\'ll have to talk to Billy about it,  of course.',
'Sure. Of course. I got you. Okay.',
'I have to go to the office. I\'m sorry.',
'I\'m sorry I busted up your lunch.',
'No, it\'s so worth it.',
'Hopefully you\'ll feel the same.',
'We\'ll see.',
'Okay.',
'See, you sweetheart. Pumpkin, hmm? ( Laughter ) take care.',
'\"Pumpkin.\" That\'s cute.',
'Don\'t ask. He\'s in this retro, mushy mood today. But this  thing... This is so awesome.',
'You think?',
'Yeah.',
'Well, how did I do with your dad?',
'About as good as you\'re going to do with me.',
'Yeah.',
'And it led you here?',
'Yeah.',
'Well, is there anything telling you that it\'s not true, that it can\'t  be true?',
'A couple of things. My gut mostly. I just need proof.',
'Well, I can\'t give it to you. I\'m sorry.',
'There is something that we can do. We can do an DNA test. It  wouldn\'t tell us that we\'re brothers, but it would tell us that we\'re not  brothers.',
'You want my blood. ( Laughs )',
'What else is new?',
'Yeah. Well, it won\'t hurt this time. Okay.',
'I\'ll set it up at the hospital.',
'Sure.',
'I\'ll call you.',
'Okay. Well, wouldn\'t it be interesting?',
'Yeah, wouldn\'t it? It doesn\'t mean anything, you know. They\'re  chromosomes. It\'s a luck of the draw. It\'s nothing.',
'But still...',
'Yeah. But still. ',
'Can I bring you something else?',
'Yeah, yeah. I\'ll have an ice tea with lemon, please. Ben  Reade\'s head on a platter.',
'Well, it\'s been great, Ramona. And you know, like I said, I\'m  sorry to I have to cut it short.',
'Well, I know about sick aunts.',
'Oh, thank you. All right, well, I\'m going to...',
'Wait. Don\'t you want your tip?',
'No, no. Really...',
'No, really I insist. I mean, it\'s not your fault that things got  side-tracked. You should get paid.',
'Okay. Thanks.',
'Well, come on in.',
'What\'s wrong? ',
'Nothing.',
'Did everything go okay between Josh and Tony?',
'Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think... It went great. Josh said that he  would think about it, but Tony and Marah think he\'s leaning towards yes.',
'All right. That\'s great. So where are they?',
'They... I don\'t know. They took off. They looked they wanted  to be alone.',
'Right. You\'re going to tell me what\'s going on?',
'Hmm?',
'Well, you look like you\'ve just seen a ghost. And my  champagne is gone, and I don\'t think you drank it all by yourself. So who  was here and what has happened?',
'Gus Aitoro was here.',
'Did he rattle your cage?',
'No, no, no, no. Well, why are you back so fast? I mean, you...  Yeah. I mean...',
'I ran into the evil brother, and I just couldn\'t go on.',
'Who?',
'Edmund.',
'Who?',
'The new U.S. Ambassador from San Cristobal.',
'( Laughs ) wow! No. You\'re joking.',
'I wish I were joking. I will never understand how he shares  even a drop of blood with Richard.',
'Yeah. Well, it\'s the luck of the draw. It\'s those chromosomes,  so they say. Or so Aitoro says.',
'You and Gus were talking about chromosomes?',
'Mm-hmm. And brotherhood.',
'Why?',
'It seems like Aitoro may have found one.',
'Hey.',
'Hey, I...',
'Don\'t cut me off. There\'s something I want to tell you.',
'Wow!',
'Yeah.',
'That\'s great. There\'s something else that\'s come up. Somebody  else is here. She\'s here. Eden is here. She\'s back.',
'You didn\'t kick her out of the house?',
'No, of course, not. That stuff with Phillip and Zach is settled.  None of that matters anymore.',
'Still. Still, still.',
'Still nothing. Is she my favorite person? Will she ever be my  favorite person? Not a chance. She is your sister.',
'Was. Was my sister.',
'Hey. You know, if you want to cut me out of your will, I won\'t  fight it. You know, if you want me to go, I will.',
'You don\'t have to. You don\'t have to go.',
'I\'ll always be your little sister, Nicky. And if you want me to, I\'ll  help you find your real birth parents.',
'I appreciate that. But there\'s no way that you could know who.',
'No, but I think I might know who has the answer.',
'Mom, what did you say?',
'Go.  Please, go away.',
'No, mom.  No, you don\'t mean that.  No, you don\'t want me to leave.  In Italy you begged me to come home with you.',
'You -- you refused.  Broke my heart.',
'Oh, mom, I\'m so sorry.  I should\'ve come then.  I just -- it doesn\'t matter.  I\'m here now.  I\'m back.',
'Back?  To stay?',
'Let\'s not talk about that, okay?  I just want you to concentrate on getting better, mom.',
'Just go.  Just go, please.',
'Mom.',
'If you\'re not back to stay, I don\'t want you back at all.',
'No.',
'You know, you\'d better get used to it.',
'What?',
'Macy spending time with her family.  They mean a lot to her.',
'I know a lot more about my wife than you think.',
'That\'s something you shouldn\'t get used to -- calling Macy your wife.',
'But she is my wife, in every sense of the word.',
'For now.',
'Until death do us part.',
'So what?  You\'re gonna hold her to this marriage that you conned her into?',
'She married me freely -- of her own choice.',
'Well, if it makes you feel better to believe that then --',
'I will feel better when Macy and I are on a plane back to Italy.',
'Macy\'s here to stay, my friend.',
'Macy\'s back in Los Angeles?',
'Yeah, Clarke.  Yeah, she is.',
'Oh, good.  When she get here?  Where is she now?',
'She\'s in with Sally.',
'Great.  Great, this is exactly what Sally needs.  This is better than great.  So, how did she get here? ',
'I brought her.',
'Who are you?',
'I\'m Lorenzo, Macy\'s husband.',
'Look, don\'t worry about it.  We\'ll take care of it.',
'Okay.',
'We\'re all keeping a good thought out for your mom, C.J.',
'Thanks.',
'Hey, Ceej, Raquel.  Have you guys seen a cellular biology book anywhere?',
'No, I\'m sorry, I haven\'t.',
'Me neither.',
'Oh, God, I must\'ve left it at Ridge\'s.  And I have an exam.',
'Look, don\'t worry about anything here, C.J.  Everything will be fine.',
'Thank you so much.',
'What\'s going on?',
'Oh -- my mom, she\'s in the hospital.  She had a heart attack.',
'My God.  C.J., Why didn\'t you call me?',
'I -- things got really crazy, and I had to come back here and --',
'No, no, no, it\'s okay, it\'s okay, it\'s okay.  How is she?  How\'s she doing?',
'Not good.',
'Honey, I\'m so sorry.',
'Yeah, and I -- I gotta --',
'C.J., You know how strong she is, don\'t you?',
'I know she\'s gonna be okay.',
'It\'s up to you to do that now.',
'Yeah, and what if I can\'t?',
'You can.  C.J., I\'ve seen your strength firsthand.  I know you can. Come on, honey, we\'re gonna go to the hospital.  Come on.',
'No, no, no, wait, I thought you had an exam to study for.',
'No, no, that can wait.',
'C.J., Come on.',
'Bridget -- I\'ll be okay.  My dad is there.  And -- I\'ll be fine.',
'All right.  Okay, but I\'m gonna cell you the second my exam is done, okay?',
'Thank you.',
'C.J., I know whatever happens at that hospital, you can handle it.',
'Is he serious?',
'I\'m afraid so, yeah.',
'Well, I suppose I should welcome you to the family.',
'Thank you.',
'I wouldn\'t roll out the red carpet just yet.',
'Dad.',
'Oh, Mark.  I\'ve been looking for Dr. Cooper everywhere.  They say he\'s in surgery, but, you know, Sally hasn\'t woken up yet.',
'Then why hasn\'t she woken up yet?',
'\'Cause we had her sedated.  And she is taking a little longer than usual to come out of it, but it\'s nothing to worry about.',
'You sure about that?',
'There\'s no guarantees in medicine, but the tests indicate that she\'s making a recovery.',
'Yeah, well, if you don\'t mind, I\'m gonna check that out for myself.',
'No, no, no.  You can\'t go in there.',
'Why not?',
'Because Dr. Cooper\'s in there.',
'So?',
'I know that feeling.',
'Oh, God, mom.  I am so sorry.  I am so sorry that I had to let you think that I was dead.',
'Had to?',
'I\'m so sorry.  Yes, for daddy.  To protect him.  You said you understood in Italy.',
'Yes, but -- but you disappeared without even so much as a good- bye.',
'You left a message?  Like a stranger?',
'No, no.  Mom, that is not true.  You mean everything in the world to me.',
'Enough to stay?',
'I will be here for you as long as you need me.',
'That\'s not good enough, honey.',
'Oh, mom.  Mom, listen to me.  Look at me.  I love you.',
'It\'s no good.  I can\'t do this.  If you don\'t love me enough to stay, then I don\'t want any part of you.',
'Oh, there you are.  Ridge.',
'Hey, I didn\'t expect to see you here.',
'Oh, forgot this.  Big exam coming up.',
'Oh.  Well, I\'m glad you\'re here, actually.  I want to ask your opinion on something.',
'Well, I really have to get going.',
'Won\'t take long, I promise.  I just wanted to see what you think.',
'Okay.  What is it?',
'This.',
'Wow.',
'Well, that would answer my first question.',
'It\'s so beautiful.  What\'s your second?',
'Do you think your mom would like it?',
'Belonged to dad\'s grandmother.',
'Wow.  A Forrester heirloom.  It must mean a lot to you, huh?',
'I always liked this one.  Taylor didn\'t like it so much.  She always said it wasn\'t really her.',
'Yeah, I can see that.  It\'s -- it\'s a little too flashy for her.',
'How \'bout for your mom?',
'Does it really matter what I think?',
'Yes, of course it does.',
'Okay.  I think she\'ll like it.',
'But --',
'But maybe it\'s a little too soon.',
'Look, Ridge, I -- I just want you to be happy.  So if this makes you happy --',
'Okay, that\'s what I wanted to hear.  You know, I\'d like to see what it felt like to put this on a beautiful woman\'s finger.  Would you --',
'Oh, no, Ridge.',
'Ridge -- is this an engagement ring?  Are you gonna ask my mother to marry you?',
'Dr. Cooper\'s in with mom?  Why?  What is going on?',
'I got to get back to work.',
'All right, you want to tell me what that was all about?',
'What?',
'Mark acting so weird.  Weirder than usual, anyway.',
'Oh, no, no, he wasn\'t.  You\'re just on edge.  You\'re worried about your mother.  But you heard what your brother said, things are going good.',
'Right.  And like I said, I\'m gonna check that out for myself.',
'No, no, no, no.  C.J., C.J., You can\'t go in there.  I told you Dr. Cooper\'s in there.',
'So what?',
'He wants us to wait out here.',
'All right, fine.  I\'m giving him five minutes, and then I\'m goin\' in there.',
'Let\'s go get a cup of coffee.',
'No, no, no, no.  I\'m not going anywhere until I know what\'s going on in there.',
'Mom, don\'t do this.  Don\'t do this.  We\'ve lost so much time already.',
'It was your choice, Macy, your choice.',
'I know.  I know, but not a day went by, mother, not one, when I didn\'t miss you.',
'You missed me?',
'Mother.  I know I hurt you, but I\'ll never do that again.',
'You have to promise me, Macy.  Promise -- you have to promise you\'ll never disappear from my life like that again.  Promise.',
'That\'s what this is, isn\'t it?  An engagement ring?',
'No, not exactly.',
'Ridge, come on, with me, at least be honest with yourself. You want to marry my mother.',
'Yeah, eventually, I do.  Look, Bridget, I know you have a vested interest in this.',
'What are you talking about?',
'The kids.',
'Well, I mean, I guess I\'m just scared they\'re gonna be hurt by all of this.',
'All of you?',
'Brooke, hope, me, the kids.  I\'m hoping it\'ll be the first of many gatherings like that.',
'And that\'s when you\'re going to give her the ring?',
'Not in front of the kids.  But at some point, yes.  I\'d like Brooke to know that I would like us to be together forever as a family.',
'I gotta go.',
'Bridget, what\'s up with you?',
'Nothing\'s up with me.  I have to study.  I told you.',
'No.  Something\'s happened.  You\'ve been different ever since we came back from Italy.',
'I don\'t know what you\'re talking about.',
'I\'m talking about the mysterious disappearance of my little sister.',
'I\'m the same.',
'No.  Something has changed, Bridget.  Please tell me what it is.',
'I can\'t do this.  I gotta go.',
'Do you promise, Macy?',
'Do you promise, Macy?  Promise that you\'ll stay for good?',
'I\'ll stay.',
'You\'re not just saying that because I\'m here in the hospital?',
'No.  I\'m saying it because this is where I want to be.',
'Oh, thank God.  Thank God, my darling.  Welcome home.',
'Paging Dr. Statemen.  Dr. Statemen, please.',
'Dad, who is that guy?  What, is he a friend of mom\'s or something?',
'Sort of.',
'What do you mean \"sort of\"?',
'They met in Italy.',
'So what is he doing here?',
'It\'s a long story.',
'You know what?  I\'ve had it.  I\'ve had it.  Something\'s going on here, and I\'m gonna find out what it is.',
'C.J., Wait!',
'Excuse me, doctor, I need to talk to you.',
'C.J.  --',
'Oh, my God, mom, thank God you\'re awake.  Macy?',
'Danny. ',
'Yeah, thanks for coming. ',
'I was wrong. ',
'Look, listen, Warren, Warren... ',
'Hmm? ',
'What do you expect me to do? ',
'I expect you to get her out of that hellhole tonight. ',
'You okay? ',
'Nice to see you. Excuse me. ',
'I wish you\'d try to see this from my point of view, Michelle. ',
'You know, you don\'t want me with Danny, and I get that, okay?  That\'s your point of view. I get it, I understand, so you can let me out of here. ',
'I\'m sorry, I can\'t do that. ',
'You could if you wanted to. ',
'No, this is not love. This is control. ',
'You want to talk about choices? You took away my choices. All  right, I chose Danny. You didn\'t respect that and you didn\'t respect me. ',
'I\'m your brother. I\'m not going to stand by and watch you destroy  yourself, Michelle, sorry. ',
'The only thing that you are destroying is any love, any feeling  that I have for you. ',
'I wish you would just stop fighting with me long enough to listen to  reason. ',
'This is perfect, honey. ',
'No one\'s knocking on the door, and the phones aren\'t ringing, and  we\'re together. I think it\'s better than perfect. I\'d call it heaven. ',
'Heaven. ',
'Heaven. ',
'I\'m sorry Selena interrupted us before, but... ',
'Hey, hey, hey, she\'s your mother, and you love her. It\'s okay. ',
'I think that is very great. That\'s better than great. ',
'And I love seeing you this happy. ',
'And I love being this happy, honey. And who knows? Maybe life  could get better than this. I don\'t know. I doubt it. ',
'Maybe just a little bit. ',
'Suz, what are you doing here? What happened? ',
'Daddy, you came back. ',
'Yeah, honey, of course, I came back. I was worried sick when Harley  told me that you were missing. Now, what happened? ',
'I\'m sorry, daddy. I\'m really, really sorry. ',
'Okay, what are you so sorry about? Just tell me. What\'s going on? All  right, hot shot, maybe you want to tell me. What the hell did I just walk in on  here? ',
'Hey, you\'re on the wrong track, buddy, all right? I can tell you that. ',
'Lose the attitude, hot shot. You want to go swimming again? Is that  what you want? Don\'t lie to me. I want you to tell me the truth and tell me  right now. ',
'All right. Susan went a little nuts and decided to jump in the water. I  pulled her out. That\'s it. ',
'Oh, really? That\'s not what I saw. It looked more like you were trying  to help her out of her clothes. ',
'No, daddy. See, I just jumped in the water and he pulled me out.  And he was just trying to get me warm, that\'s all. ',
'Jim? ',
'Yeah, Beth, over here. Here, honey. ',
'Is Susan all right? ',
'Beth. You brought her with you? ',
'She knows I\'m with Susan. ',
'Mm-hmm. What\'s her phone number? ',
'None of your business. ',
'Beth, hold off on that call. Instead, let\'s make a call to the cops. Tell  them we got a juvenile here out after curfew. ',
'All right, all right, just calm down. 555-1755, Ask for Drew. ',
'Don\'t think you\'re off the hook with me yet, pal. ',
'Hey, I told you what happened, okay? She jumped in the water, I  pulled her out, end of story. ',
'Suz, honey, why did you do it, huh? Did he chase you? Did he lure  you into the water? What happened? ',
'Oh, give me a break. ',
'No, it was my idea. ',
'Well, honey, if he didn\'t do anything, why were your clothes half off?  I mean, did he try to talk you into something? ',
'Well, what the hell are you trying to say? ',
'Hey, I am not talking to you! Honey, listen, you can trust me, okay?  Don\'t be afraid. Just tell me the truth. Why were your clothes half off, Susan? ',
'I was trying to be more like Beth. ',
'What did you say? ',
'You know, taking my clothes off so a guy would like me more. ',
'Oh, god, Susan... ',
'No, that\'s what she did to you. That\'s how she got you, so I figured  I could get Max here the same way. ',
'Now, hold on a second. That... ',
'No, you did not complain when she did it to you. So how can you  be mad at me? ',
'Watch your mouth, young lady. This is not about Beth. This is about  you and what you just did. And right now, you are out of control. ',
'Hey, it\'s not really her fault. I mean, if she hadn\'t taken those  sleeping pills, none of this would have happened. ',
'So what is it going to take, Ben, to get her out of there? ',
'You being patient for about 72 hours. ',
'Well, that\'s not an option. ',
'Then what? What happens? ',
'Afterwards, they have another evaluation, and my guess is that  Michelle is not going to get a positive evaluation. ',
'Because Rick can make that happen, right? He can just keep her  there for as long as he wants. Is that it? ',
'Exactly. ',
'You enjoying this? You are. ',
'No, I\'m doing my job. ',
'You know, my mother used to have a lot better judgment in hiring  the help. ',
'Thanks, man. Thanks for nothing. ',
'Of course, of course, you could try telling Dr. Rick that the danger to  your family has past and they needn\'t fear for Michelle\'s safety. ',
'Really? Yeah, and why would he believe that lie? ',
'Because it\'s not a lie. You mother found out who planted the bomb. ',
'Who? ',
'It was Bernard\'s son, Nino. ',
'I knew it. I\'m going to kill him. ',
'No, no, no, no, no. Forget it, forget it. ',
'Forget it? ',
'Why don\'t you try telling Dr. Rick that the danger is over and you  and Michelle can be together? ',
'Sure, Ben. And when that doesn\'t work, any suggestions? ',
'If that doesn\'t work, he\'s your enemy. You know what to do with  enemies, right? You find their vulnerability and you take advantage of it. ',
'You know, one day you are going to make a mistake, and when  you do, I\'m going to crush you like a bug. ',
'(Laughs) ',
'Go ahead and laugh. ',
'Ah, keep your money, Danny. I\'m in a generous mood. ',
'You have got the Santos family in the palm of your hand. Business  in the underworld must be very good. ',
'Never better, brother. Never better. ',
'I can\'t believe this. ',
'Just please calm down. ',
'No. I will calm down as soon you leave. I\'ll have no problem  calming down then, so why don\'t you get out of here? ',
'Hello, Michelle. I just came by to see how you\'re doing. ',
'This is great. This is perfect. Great, Rick. ',
'Dr. Bradford is here just to talk to you, Michelle. ',
'Michelle, that\'s simply not true. ',
'No? ',
'No. ',
'All right, I\'m going to repeat this again, Michelle. Dr. Bradford\'s  here just to talk to you. ',
'I think it\'s time Michelle and I spoke alone. ',
'Yeah, I... Michelle, I\'ll be right back. ',
'No, please don\'t. Please don\'t. ',
'Abby? Sweetheart, what are you doing here? You should be back at  the house. ',
'I don\'t believe this. Have you actually locked Michelle up to keep  her away from Danny? ',
'Nobody likes feeling like a prisoner. I don\'t like feeling a  prisoner. ',
'I asked Phillip to keep an eye on you and meta so I can deal with  Michelle. Now, if you brought along some backup, Abby, it was because... ',
'Yeah, thank god it worked. She\'s safe. ',
'I thought you went straight to bed after Dr. Bradford left. ',
'Well, I was going to, but I couldn\'t go to sleep, so I went over to  company to see Buzz just to get out of the house. Where were you? ',
'Oh, I went to the office. I had some work to catch up on. Talk to me,  though. How are you feeling? Hmm? ',
'Well, you keep on getting closer, though. ',
'No, I don\'t think so. ',
'They\'re probably all from uncle rusty. He\'s probably calling to tell  you what I did. ',
'Marah. Honey, are you okay? ',
'Yeah, I\'m fine. I\'m just really glad to be home.  >>A: How did you get home? ',
'Well, I left on a bus without uncle rusty knowing. ',
'You came all the way here from Tulsa without telling rusty? ',
'Yeah. I know I shouldn\'t have, but... Well, there just wasn\'t a lot of  time. ',
'Why? What happened? ',
'I feel really stupid saying this. ',
'Well, please tell. What? What\'s going on? ',
'Well, I guess I just got a little homesick after the lady in the gift  shop was talking about you. ',
'Lady? What lady? ',
'Oh, well, there was this gift shop on the corner of the street. That\'s  where we got this. Shayne and I bought you this together. ',
'Oh, honey, that was sweet. Oh, it\'s beautiful. ',
'The lady said that you\'d like it. ',
'Well, what was the lady\'s name? Maybe it\'s somebody I grew up  with. ',
'I don\'t know, but when she showed us the bracelet, I knew I had to  get it for you. See all the little charms? ',
'Mm-hmm. ',
'They reminded me of you. ',
'Aw, \"courage, love, trust, honor, family, truth, charity.\" ',
'All those things mean a lot to you, don\'t they? ',
'Mm-hmm. ',
'Especially family. ',
'Yes, family means more than anything to me. ',
'That\'s what the lady said. ',
'So, this lady that you keep you talking about, can you describe her? ',
'Well, she was really, really old. ',
'I wonder who that could be? ',
'I haven\'t the faintest idea. ',
'She did what? ',
'We need more time like this, just you and I together. You know? I  mean, Max is a great kid and all, but... ',
'I know. I know. We have to build his room. A.S.A.P., I know. And  for him too, you know? He\'s at that age. He needs his privacy. ',
'(Laughs) ',
'What? ',
'You\'re starting to sound more and more like a mother. ',
'Hey, I\'m responsible for him. You know that? I have to make sure  that he eats right and that he gets enough sleep for school and... ',
'(Snickers) ',
'I have to keep him out of trouble. What? I do sound like his mother! ',
'Thank you. And, you know, even though he\'s not my brother, I  couldn\'t love him any more than I do. ',
'(Laughs) we\'re like some weird family for the 1990\'s. ',
'Um-um. I thought that was off the hook. Come on, don\'t get that.  (Continues ringing) no, no, don\'t get that. ',
'Honey! Hello? What? I\'ll be right there. ',
'What? What\'s going on? ',
'Honey... ',
'What\'s going on? ',
'Hurry up and get dressed. ',
'What\'s going on? ',
'Something\'s happened to Max. He\'s in trouble. Come on. ',
'Susan, you deliberately tried to hurt yourself? Honey, what were you  thinking about? ',
'I was so unhappy when you left with Beth that I just couldn\'t take it  anymore. ',
'Susan, get real. ',
'Hey, this is none of your business. ',
'She\'s lying to you. I mean, that\'s not why she took those pills. ',
'No... I know I made a mistake, daddy, but I felt so alone. ',
'Susan, suicide is nothing to joke about. You\'re going to make your  old man nuts for nothing. ',
'Don\'t listen to him, daddy. I took the pills, honest. ',
'All right, you, the truth. Did she take the sleeping pills or what? ',
'Yeah, but she didn\'t mean to. ',
'What the hell is that supposed to mean? ',
'You go figure it out. ',
'Look, I just want to know what\'s going on here. Susan, how did you  take sleeping pills when you didn\'t want to take them? ',
'It was an accident. ',
'They were in her soda. ',
'What? ',
'Who asked you?! ',
'How did the sleeping pills get in your soda? ',
'They were... I put them in Beth\'s soda, and then the drinks got  mixed up. ',
'Oh, my god. ',
'Are you telling me that you deliberately drugged Beth\'s drink? ',
'Yes. I deliberately tried to put her to sleep. ',
'Jeez, Susan. Did I hear you correctly? You said you deliberately tried  to but Beth to sleep? What are you saying?! ',
'Susan, you hate me enough to want to hurt me? ',
'I didn\'t mean for anything bad to happen, dad. ',
'No, shut your mouth, okay? There\'s no excuse for what you did, none. ',
'I am sorry, okay? ',
'No, it\'s not okay, young lady. I don\'t know what the hell has happened  to you. And where did you come up with an insane idea like this in the first  place? ',
'Why don\'t you chill out, all right? If you hadn\'t been, you know,  paying so little attention to her, you would have seen that she was upset. ',
'Daddy, that\'s not fair. ',
'Don\'t talk to me about fair, Susan, not after what you just did. ',
'Max? Max, oh, my god. We got here as soon as we could. What  happened? Are you okay? ',
'Max... Max is fine. Susan\'s the one that\'s in trouble. But you know,  Drew, she only seems to get in trouble when she\'s hanging around with your  brother. ',
'Ben, all your bragging about cutting ties with the Santos\'s, what was  that, just empty talk? ',
'No, I told you I was going to play out my hand, and I did. Luckily,  things worked out. ',
'So far. ',
'I am set for life. ',
'The question is, what is the life expectancy of an attorney who  works for the Santos family? ',
'(Laughs) I\'ll ask my replacement and get back to you, because I am  retiring from the legal profession for the moment to become president of  Sancorp. ',
'You\'ve got to be kidding. ',
'Nope. I think Sancorp could be Spaulding\'s worst nightmare. Ross:  Congratulations. ',
'Thank you. Want to head up my legal department? ',
'No, I would not. ',
'Pity. After all, Alan\'s been a thorn in your side for years. You could  get back at him. ',
'Revenge is a negative energy. It brings on bad karma, Ben. You\'re  going to have to learn that the hard way, I guess. ',
'Suit yourself. It would rock the world, though, everybody seeing you  and me fighting Alan\'s dragons together. ',
'Let me guess. Is there somebody named Carmen involved in this  new venture of yours? ',
'It is a perfectly legitimate enterprise. ',
'(Laughs) wake up and smell something. Don\'t kid yourself. ',
'Well, she told me a lot of things, but she did not mention that. ',
'You talked to her today? ',
'Excuse me for interrupting, Ross. ',
'Lynn, we were supposed to meet at the office. ',
'Well, you said you wanted the quarterlies as soon as possible. ',
'Yeah, I know what I said. ',
'Well, sign here and you\'ll be a single taxpayer from now on. ',
'So, you and Blake are officially divorced. ',
'Thank you, Lynn. ',
'Not a problem, Ross. Take care. ',
'Yes, you, too. ',
'So am I right? ',
'Blake is now free to pursue the kind of life that she wants, hopefully  without you included. ',
'Come on, Michelle, I\'m not the enemy here. Please talk to  me. Tell me what\'s on your mind. I promise you I\'ll be fair. ',
'You want to know what\'s on my mind? ',
'Yes, I do. ',
'You know, this is not helping you. ',
'You know something, doctor? My brother thinks that I want to  be a part of a crime family. And Rick is never wrong. So apparently, that\'s  what I am. ',
'You know you don\'t mean that. ',
'Yes, I do. This whole thing started with Danny\'s mother. She  tried to kill me for marrying him, you know. ',
'No, I didn\'t. ',
'Mm-hmm, yeah. She tried to kill me. Several times, actually.  But-- ha!-- I\'m still alive. ',
'Let me get this straight. You have a mother-in-law that  wants you dead? But you\'re willing to risk it to stay with Danny. ',
'He\'s my husband. I love him. And if Rick think that that is  crazy, then he is the one that needs to be in here, not me. ',
'All right, let me just... Let me just clarify everything, okay? I was  trying to protect my sister, like I\'m trying to protect my wife. ',
'But you can\'t keep us under lock and key. You have no right to do  that. ',
'Abby, please listen to me, all right? I need you to back me up on this  with Michelle. ',
'What, you want me to take your side on this? ',
'This is about doing what\'s right. ',
'Doing what you think is right. ',
'What do you mean? ',
'You know, it may take a while, but she\'ll come around. ',
'I don\'t care. I\'d rather have my sister alive and not speaking to me,  then hit from some stray bullet. ',
'Rick. Hi, Abby. ',
'Nothing\'s changed. Go. ',
'No, everything\'s changed. Hear me out. Our problems are solved. ',
'Yeah, right. ',
'Rick... ',
'Would you just listen, please? Please? ',
'Thank you. ',
'Say what you have to say. ',
'What is your problem? You\'re missing the point. ',
'You are not protecting her, you\'re controlling her! ',
'I\'m controlling? Coming from a guy that\'s brainwashed my sister to  thinking that he likes you? ',
'Is that what you think? She does love me! You\'re unbelievable! ',
'Stop it, you guys. Just stop the shouting. You\'re hurting my ears.  Stop with the shouting. ',
'I\'m sorry, honey. ',
'I\'m sorry. ',
'Yeah, whatever. ',
'Listen, why don\'t we go to the office... ',
'No. ',
'Oh, Michelle? Get off me! Get off me! Michelle? ',
'Danny?! ',
'Michelle... ',
'She\'s obviously upset, and having that here is not helping things. ',
'No. I actually think that they should spend a few minutes  together. ',
'Excuse me? What are you saying? What are you talking about? ',
'I think it would be good. I\'d like to see the dynamic between  the two of them. It might help us to find a way to help her. ',
'I didn\'t come home because I was scared. It was just that what  happened with that lady was so weird. I mean, how did she know all that stuff  about you? ',
'Good question. ',
'But she was right, mama. I mean, you did go on a trip. ',
'Well, she said that I was getting a really good deal on the bracelet. ',
'Oh, that old line. What else? ',
'Um... Oh, she said that you should wear the bracelet because it will  bring you good luck. ',
'Well, now, what else is she going to say? What, that I should throw  the bracelet away because it\'s cursed or something? ',
'You\'re right. I guess she was just pushing my buttons. ',
'Well, I think it\'s a beautiful bracelet, and I thank you and Shayne for  getting it for me. ',
'Well, I got rusty on the phone, and I was right. He was happy to hear  that you\'re safe. And every gray hair that he gets from here on in is your fault. ',
'(Laughs) you know what, though? It is late, and you should  probably go say your prayers and hop into bed, and we\'ll talk about all this in  the morning. ',
'So you\'re not mad that I came home the way I did? ',
'No, I probably should be, but I\'m not. Because the truth is, is that I  missed you, too, sweetie-pie. Good night, okay? ',
'Thanks, mama. You, too, daddy. ',
'Good night, sweetheart. Off to bed, go, go, go. ',
'Oh... When I was talking to the lady, she Drew a picture and she  said to make sure that I gave it to you. ',
'Picture? What is it? ',
'It\'s kind of weird, isn\'t it? It\'s the same design as the one on the  ring that aunt Cassie found. How did she know, mama? How did a total  stranger know? ',
'I have no idea. I really have no idea. ',
'Well, maybe your hearing is whacked because you\'re missing the  point here. ',
'No, you are, okay? You really are. Because your precious little  daughter, she is the problem here. ',
'I found them in each other\'s arms. ',
'He saved her life! ',
'Look, Susan\'s clothes were half off. Drew, you didn\'t see how close  there, okay? I did. ',
'Well, what do you want him to do, huh? You want him to save her  life and dump her on the beach somewhere? ',
'In the diner? Oh, please. They wouldn\'t even have been here if she  hadn\'t dragged him in there, too, right? ',
'Okay, okay. Why don\'t we go home, cool off, and we can talk about  this in the morning? ',
'Calm down. ',
'I\'m not going to calm down! ',
'Oh, you take good care of him? That\'s why you didn\'t know where the  hell he was until Beth called you tonight. Look at this. We got a child raising a  child. ',
'Why don\'t you back of my sister, pal? And do it now. ',
'So, you and Blake are divorced, but you don\'t want me to see her.  That\'s interesting, Ross. ',
'Interesting? It\'s ironic. It\'s many things. Call it what you want. ',
'So much for detente? ',
'Leave her alone. You\'ve hurt her enough. ',
'(Laughs) you\'re the one with the itchy trigger finger, remember? ',
'Well, if you\'re working for the Santos family, you better get used to  trigger fingers. ',
'Ross, you\'re not her husband anymore. Blake and I are developing a  very nice friendship, thank you, with or without your blessing. ',
'I have always wanted the best for Blake, as you know. ',
'She wants time for herself. Everybody should give it to her. Good  night, Ben. Say hi to Carmen for me. ',
'I love you. ',
'I love you. Hey, look, it\'s really important you stay calm, okay?  Okay? ',
'Fine. They can spend some time together, but I don\'t trust him and I  want to be in there with him. ',
'Oh, no. If anybody is going to go in there with them, it should be  me. ',
'Oh, no, Abby, no way. No way! ',
'Rick, after this stunt that you pulled, everybody\'s mad at you.  You\'re only going to turn it into another shouting match. ',
'I agree with Abigail. Come on, Rick, please. Don\'t make it  worse than it is. ',
'All right, fine. I\'ll wait out here. ',
'Good. All right, you can have a few minutes. ',
'Oh, I can? Thank you. Thank you very much. She\'s my wife. ',
'I love you, sweetie. I\'m on your side. I don\'t want to interfere. I\'m  just going to be right over here. ',
'Come here. Are you okay? ',
'I can\'t believe this. I can\'t believe after everything we\'ve just  been through, I just want to be with you. ',
'I know. I\'m going to get you out of here, okay? I promise. ',
'There has to be something you can do, right? There has to be a  way for you to get me out of here. ',
'Look. I told Rick that the danger\'s over. We found out who planted  the bomb and we settled our differences with those people. ',
'Okay, so great, so we can get me out of here. Let\'s go. ',
'Michelle, he\'s still not going to let you out, not yet. ',
'No, no, no, no he\'s not, he\'s not. ',
'I just want to go home with you. ',
'You will, I promise. I promise. ',
'You know, sweetie, the more I look at this, the more I can see how  you would see that the two crests match, but they don\'t. ',
'Mama, it\'s the exact same design. ',
'No, sweetie, but it\'s not. ',
'Well, let me see the ring. I can prove it to you. ',
'You know what? It\'s so late, and you\'re tired. You go to bed, and  we\'ll talk about it in the morning. ',
'Okay. ',
'Okay? ',
'I just thought it was kind of spooky. ',
'You know what? It\'s nothing for you to worry about. Now go to  sleep. I love you, and I thank you. ',
'Okay, good night. ',
'For the bracelet. Good night. ',
'Come on. You get a good night\'s sleep now, okay, sweetheart? ',
'Okay. ',
'And we\'re going to figure out in the morning how to get you back to  Tulsa, all right? ',
'Okay. Uncle rusty needs me anyway. Shayne and Timmy are  constantly fighting. ',
'I\'m sure ',
'Good night. ',
'Good night, sweetheart. ',
'Thanks. ',
'It\'s a perfect match, Joshua, it is. ',
'You know what? She\'s right. This is getting spooky. ',
'Yeah, you can say that again. ',
'How could this old woman know about you? How could she know  about the ring? ',
'I really have no idea, but I\'m not going to wait around to find out. ',
'What does that mean? ',
'It means we\'re going to San Cristobel. I\'m going to make airline  reservations. ',
'Apologize, man. ',
'Listen, listen, just back off. All right? You don\'t want to make  things any worse than they are. ',
'He\'s right, okay, Max? I love you for defending me, but you don\'t  have to. I didn\'t do anything wrong. You didn\'t either. No one did. ',
'Susan, let\'s go to the car. ',
'Get your hands off me! ',
'Susan! ',
'I just meant I could walk to the car by myself. ',
'Social services? No! ',
'I\'m going to call them first thing in the morning. ',
'No, you can\'t do that. ',
'I can, and I will. And I\'m doing it for his sake as well as yours. ',
'You know, you should have torn that guy\'s head off or something. ',
'No, I shouldn\'t have. Okay? You don\'t make bad situations worse,  all right, Max? ',
'How would that have been making a bad situation worse? ',
'Look, we\'ll talk about it later, all right? Do you have your moped?  Can you get home? ',
'Don\'t worry, don\'t worry, don\'t worry. ',
'Jesse, it\'ll kill me. I can\'t lose him. I can\'t lose him. ',
'We\'ll find a way to fix this, okay? ',
'We have to, Jesse. We have to. ',
'I promise you. ',
'I can\'t believe this. This is ridiculous. It\'s ridiculous. Look, I am  going to get you out of here very soon, I promise. ',
'You have to, because I\'m dying in here, Danny. I can\'t deal with  this. I can\'t handle this. ',
'Michelle, listen, listen to me. You have to be very cool with her,  okay? And I will bring you home. ',
'Okay. ',
'What are you doing? What are you doing? You\'re not leaving them  alone, are you? ',
'Yes, I am. And so are you. ',
'What do you mean? What are you saying, Abby? ',
'I\'m saying what you\'re doing is wrong. ',
'Damn it, Abby, I love my sister, and I\'m not going to see her get  killed. ',
'Rick, you\'re trying to control her the way my parents tried to  control me. ',
'No, I\'m not. ',
'Yes. They honestly thought they were doing the right thing and so  do you, and it\'s wrong. ',
'But Danny\'s family is part of a mob. ',
'You know what? I\'m no happier with Danny\'s situation than you  are, but we have to love Michelle enough to allow her to be free to love  Danny. ',
'Oh, my god. Where... Where is this coming from, Abby? Where? ',
'Maybe at one time they should, but not now, Abby. ',
'This is so cool.  Just don\'t mess with the hair, okay?  You didn\'t feel  anything, right?  ',
'Right.  You were completely right.  ',
'So it\'s just best to leave a fantasy a fantasy.  ',
'Reality just never measures up.  ',
'Absolutely.  ',
'So I, um -- guess that settles that.  ',
'Totally.  ',
'I guess, um -- ',
'I guess I better go.  You know, the kids are waiting.  ',
'Right.  ',
'Dinner.  ',
'Tell them I said hi.  ',
'I will.  ',
'Bye.  ',
'Good.  Good, um -- yeah.  ',
'Okay.  ',
'Bye.     ',
'April, you can\'t be accosting our clients.  Forrester does business  with tons of celebrities.  ',
'I didn\'t accost him.  I auditioned for him.  ',
'And Craig Kilborn\'s producer wanted you to be on the show?  ',
'He said someone would call me.  ',
'When?  ',
'When they had an opening.  ',
'April, I\'m sorry, but that producer blew you off.  ',
'No, he said -- ',
'\"Don\'t call us.  We\'ll call you?\" ',
'It wasn\'t like that.  ',
'April, I know you want this whole singing thing to pan out, but it  doesn\'t just happen overnight.  ',
'No.  I got Lucky.  I was in the right place at the right time.  And I  did my bit, and the producer was impressed.  ',
'Amber just doesn\'t want you to get your hopes up, okay?  ',
'I know what it\'s like, April.  Everybody says you\'re great.   Everybody says that they\'re gonna call.  But nobody does.  ',
'No, they just don\'t call you.  ',
'Okay, look.  Amber\'s isn\'t trying to hurt your feelings.  She\'s just  telling you the truth.  L.A.  Can be a really tough place.  ',
'Ridge says you\'re a real math wiz.  ',
'Math is okay.  ',
'It\'s not your favorite subject?  ',
'I like science.  ',
'Really?  I was a chemist before I was CEO at Forrester creations.  ',
'Hey, it looks like you guys started without me.  ',
'Daddy, you\'re home!  ',
'Hey.  I didn\'t think I was that late.  ',
'Well, the girls were hungry, and Thomas and I said they didn\'t  have to wait.  ',
'I see.  So what we having?  ',
'Burritos!  ',
'Sea bass and Seviche for the grownups.  ',
'Did you have Catherine order from Las Olas?  ',
'No, I did it myself.  ',
'We all went and picked it up!  ',
'Well, I feel like I missed all the fun.  ',
'There\'s a lot left in the kitchen.  ',
'Okay, well, I\'ll have to go out and make myself a plate.  ',
'Or you can share those strained carrots with hope.  I think she got  half that bowl all over her face.  ',
'Well, maybe I will.  Mwah.  ',
'Carrots.  Ahh.  ',
'Huh?  ',
'Bridget, what happened?  What\'s going on?  ',
'Ridge and I just kissed.  ',
'Wait, so you and Ridge just kissed each other?  ',
'Yeah.  ',
'When?  When?  Just now?  He\'s not still here, is he?  ',
'No, no.  He left.  He\'s gone.  ',
'So, what, he just kissed you and then took off?  ',
'He was -- he was trying to cure me.  ',
'Uh, of what?  ',
'My feelings for him.  He said that they weren\'t romantic, and he  could prove it with a kiss.  ',
'And you let him?  ',
'It was an experiment.  ',
'Whatever.  Wait a minute.  An experiment?  I don\'t understand.   What are you talking about?  ',
'He thought that once we kissed that I would be over it.  ',
'I see, and what, this is something that you didn\'t want to do?  ',
'No, I was just -- I was nervous.  ',
'Nervous?  You seem a little freaked out, Bridget.  ',
'I\'m fine.  I\'m fine.  I just need a second to catch my breath, you  know?  ',
'Must\'ve been some kiss.  ',
'It was.  ',
'So, did it work?  I mean, Ridge\'s little experiment?  Did you feel  anything?  Were there fireworks?  ',
'It was the fourth of July, times ten.  ',
'So what kept you?  I heard that Spectra was swamped with orders  after Portofino.  ',
'Actually, I stopped by Bridget\'s.  She said to say hi to all of you.  ',
'Is she coming over soon?  ',
'I don\'t know.  She\'s pretty -- pretty busy with her schoolwork.  ',
'I\'m glad she didn\'t go to Copenhagen.  ',
'We all are, sport.  ',
'How is she?  ',
'Good.  Busy.  ',
'I\'m really proud of her.  She stayed focused through all of this,  everything that\'s happened this year, and she\'s doing really well.  ',
'She\'s pretty incredible, all right.  Like mother, like daughter.  ',
'Well, thank you.  That\'s very sweet.  But I don\'t think I could have  handled everything that Bridget has at her age.  ',
'I don\'t know many people that could.  ',
'And I\'m sure that your father\'s just as proud of all of you.  ',
'You bet I am.  Talk about doing well in school -- Thomas has done  a complete turnaround this term.  ',
'Oh?  ',
'Oh, yeah.  His teachers are very, very proud.  Had a little rough go  of it there for a while, but I think that\'s all behind him.  ',
'Oh, that\'s great, Thomas.  ',
'I got an \"a\" on my spelling test.  ',
'Yes, you did.   And Steffy aced her book report.  Didn\'t y u, kiddo?  ',
'All right.  I\'m starting to feel a little intimidated here.  Having  dinner with all of these geniuses.  ',
'Yeah, well, I know what you mean.  These guys amaze their old  man every day.  ',
'April, I don\'t mean to sound like a pessimist, but you have to be  realistic.  ',
'I\'ll get it.  ',
'Amber Forrester\'s office.  This is she.  ',
'April, great.  This is Craig Kilborn\'s producer.  We met earlier?  ',
'Whoa.  Well, hello.  ',
'I\'d like to offer you a slot on the show tonight.        ',
'All right, you guys.  Girls, you need to get to sleep.  And Thomas,  you\'ve got homework.  ',
'Will you come up with us, Brooke?  ',
'Girls could help put hope to sleep.  ',
'Crib\'s all set up upstairs.  ',
'Thanks.  ',
'All right, girls.  Give me a kiss.  Got to put these dishes away.  ',
'Okay, c\'mon.  ',
'Good night.  ',
'Good night, dad.  ',
'Good night.  Good night.  Sleep tight.  ',
'Good night.  ',
'Well, that was a wonderful evening.  But the night\'s not over yet.   I\'ll be down as soon as I can.  ',
'You want me on the show?  ',
'The comedian we booked for tonight canceled.  ',
'But I\'m a singer.  ',
'We need to fill the spot.  You think you can do that?  ',
'I think I can do whatever you want.  ',
'Can you get down to CBS Television City in half an hour?  ',
'Oh, you bet I can.  Yeah.  ',
'It\'s at the corner of Fairfax and Beverly.  We\'ll let security know  you\'re coming.  ',
'Thank you.  Thank you so much.  ',
'What\'s going on?  ',
'I am.  I\'m going to be on \"Craig Kilborn\" tonight.  I\'m singin\'  tonight!  ',
'So when Ridge kissed you, you -- you definitely felt something?  ',
'Yeah.  I actually got weak in the knees.  ',
'Well, what about him?  ',
'He said he didn\'t feel anything.  ',
'Do you believe him?  ',
'I don\'t know.  I said the same thing.  ',
'You did.  So lied to him?  ',
'I was in shock.  I didn\'t know what to say.  ',
'Well, Bridget, if he doesn\'t have feelings for you, then you can\'t say  anything.  You don\'t say anything, and you move on.  ',
'How?  How am I supposed to do that after what I just felt?  C.J., I  don\'t know if I can.  ',
'Hello?  ',
'Hey, Princess.  ',
'Ridge, hi.  How was your dinner?  ',
'It was great.  ',
'Did the kids have fun?  ',
'Yeah, they did.  We all did.  Listen, the reason I\'m calling -- ',
'Tell them I said hi?  ',
'Yeah, I did.  Bridget, um, I know I left your place kind of abruptly.  ',
'Oh, no.  You had to get home.  ',
'Yeah, but I just wanted to make sure you were okay.  ',
'I\'m fine.  Fine.  Totally cured.  ',
'Well, okay, I -- I didn\'t want to give the wrong impression running  out of there the way I did.  ',
'Oh, no.  It was no big deal.  You had to go.  ',
'Yeah.  So we\'re cool?  ',
'Absolutely.',
'\'Cause I\'ve got to admit to you, the kiss kind of caught me off  guard.  ',
'Oh, Ridge, I mean -- don\'t worry about it.  Really.  It was just an  experiment.  And you were right.  It worked.  I\'m totally over you.  ',
'That\'s good to know.  It\'s good to know.  Well, I guess I\'ll get  going.  I\'ll see you soon.  ',
'Have a good night.  ',
'That was good.  ',
'C.J., I was lying through my teeth.  ',
'I know.  But what?  ',
'Ridge?  ',
'Logan, I didn\'t see you standing there.  ',
'Who was that?  On the phone?  Who have you been kissing?  ',
'Hey, you. ',
'What\'s up? ',
'How are you doing? ',
'What\'s the matter, you don\'t get a day off in this place? ',
'Well, I guess not. Ever since Buzz headed for the hills, this place  is my responsibility, whether I like it or not. ',
'That\'s right, he went to England. ',
'That\'s right. ',
'Has he called you yet? ',
'Well, at least you\'ve gotten past that guilt stage, right? Have you? ',
'I have nothing to be guilty about. I didn\'t force Buzz to kiss me.  You know, if he can\'t deal with his feelings, that\'s his problem, all right? ',
'That\'s right. ',
'You know? Anyway, enough of my nonexistent love life. Did you  tell Jesse you didn\'t want to marry him yet? ',
'What? ',
'Well... ',
'Wait a minute. I never said that. ',
'Well, excuse me. The last I heard, you were making all kinds of  excuses to try to get out of it, including the fact that you\'re Jewish, of all  things. ',
'That\'s all? ',
'Yes. I just want to take it slow, anyway. ',
'Well, I\'m glad I caught you. ',
'Hi. ',
'He\'s glad he caught you. What have you got there? ',
'I\'ve got a couple of airline tickets to take your daughter to L.A. ',
'Oh, that\'s right. You guys are going to your father\'s unveiling. And  I\'m going to take care of Max. ',
'Right. I hope you don\'t mind. Do you? ',
'No. ',
'Because I really have to do this, you know? ',
'No, I get along great with Max. ',
'Oh. ',
'It\'s you I\'m worried about. ',
'Yeah, well, most people go to California for fun, but not me. ',
'Well, I was hoping that this would cheer you up. I went by the city  hall this morning, and I got our application to get our marriage license. ',
'If we\'re going to spend a day at the beach, you\'re going to have to  cover yourself in this stuff. ',
'Well, only if you put it on me. ',
'Ooh, can I? ',
'I just can\'t believe we\'re actually going to spend the whole day  together. ',
'I just can\'t believe that I\'m finally going to get to see you in that  bikini. ',
'Hey, Bill! I was just going to call you. ',
'Hey, Ben. ',
'He wants to use my program? ',
'He wants to use it by labor day. ',
'Well, that doesn\'t give me much time. ',
'What, were you roaming the entire city looking for Bill so that he  could get back to work? ',
'Actually, I was looking for Bill\'s friend, David, who I managed to get  out on bail. But we still have to work on a defense strategy. ',
'Oh, yeah, look, Ben, thanks again for stepping in on that. Really, I  appreciate it. ',
'Well, there\'s nothing I wouldn\'t do for Sancorp\'s new software star. ',
'Well, if there\'s anything I can do for you, please, please, just say the  word. ',
'I will. But just finish that program. Once we have that, there\'s nothing  that could stop either one of us. ',
'Mmm. Don\'t say a word. Oh, I wish this moment could last forever. ',
'That\'d be nice, wouldn\'t it? ',
'Do we really have to wake up and go back to the real world? ',
'I\'m afraid so. Eventually, one of us is going to get hungry.',
'But we are here, Vicky. And maybe that\'s exactly why we should  talk about what this means. ',
'Well, it means we spent an incredible evening together. And we  should start working on the morning. ',
'Look. Last night was... It was incredible. It really was. But that\'s  exactly why I don\'t think it should happen again. ',
'What do you mean, it shouldn\'t happen again? ',
'I can\'t be responsible for ruining your life. After this morning, we  can\'t let this happen again. We can\'t be seen together. ',
'Hey, come on, sweetie. Now, Selena put extra chocolate chips in  those pancakes for you. ',
'I\'m not hungry. ',
'Come on, Lizzie. I can\'t believe you\'re going to pass up all that  chocolate for breakfast. ',
'Yeah. ',
'I don\'t care about breakfast  all I care about is grandpa Alan. ',
'Hey, honey, grandpa Alan is going to be fine. He has uncle Rick and  all those other doctors taking very good care of him. ',
'Then why can\'t I see for myself? Why can\'t I go to the hospital? ',
'Because I told you, honey, grandpa Alan had a heart attack, and he  needs his rest. But you will be able to see him soon, I promise you. ',
'Yeah, Lizzie. Come on, Suze, back us up here. ',
'Your mom\'s right. You should do what she says. ',
'Yes. Sweetie, visiting grandpa just isn\'t a good idea right now. ',
'You\'re hiding something. I can see it in your eyes. It\'s bad, isn\'t it?  Really bad. ',
'No. No. ',
'Grandpa Alan\'s going to die, isn\'t he? He\'s going to die. ',
'Just make sure that stays. ',
'Okay. ',
'Hey, Phillip. ',
'Is he doing well? ',
'No, there\'s been no change. But we got the test results back. ',
'Oh, okay. And? ',
'Okay, well, you said you knew that. So what are you going to do? ',
'We\'re using a drug called T.P.A. To try to clear out the clot in his  artery. If that doesn\'t work, Charles Grant\'s going to want to do an  angioplasty. ',
'But what does that mean, Rick? Is he going to be all right?',
'Phillip, we\'re not going to know anything for at least another 24  hours. ',
'Okay. ',
'All right? ',
'Phillip? ',
'He\'s out in the hall. He\'s going to be in here in a few minutes. He  just needed to get a cup of coffee. He spent the night here. ',
'Harley and the baby? ',
'You\'re going to have a new grandson any day now. But your  family\'s waiting for you. ',
'Don\'t wait. ',
'What do you mean, don\'t wait? ',
'Better off without me. ',
'Oh, no, no. . Don\'t you... No, don\'t dare think that. Alan, you\'re  going to fight. Alan, you have to fight. ',
'I thought you should see what I can do before made a decision about  hiring me. ',
'So you just showed up and started working? ',
'Well, actually, I slept here last night. I wanted to get an early start on  the animals in the fields. And I\'ll tell you what, this farm ain\'t dead yet. ',
'Okay. Okay. You\'re hired. ',
'That\'s just what I wanted to hear. ',
'Sorry about yesterday. I mean, Blake is not usually that rude. And  you kind of took us by surprise. ',
'I do that from time to time. ',
'So, do you want to come in for some breakfast? I guess we should  talk about arrangements. ',
'Yeah, I\'ll come in and talk a little later. Right now, there\'s lots of  work to do. ',
'Okay. Sam, I don\'t know how to thank you. ',
'You just did. ',
'Cassie, I thought I\'d find you here. ',
'Hey. ',
'Listen. I wanted to talk to you about what happened yesterday with  that fellow, Sam. ',
'Sam? ',
'Yeah, I know he needs   A job. ',
'Are you finished? ',
'I\'m just asking you to keep an open mind. ',
'I did. I hired him. ',
'You what? ',
'Yeah. I\'ve been trying to tell you that. There he is. ',
'Oh. ',
'It\'s all right.  >> Thank you. ',
'God, I knew Ben had a lot planned towards marketing my program,  but I didn\'t think it was going to happen this fast. ',
'Well, I\'m not surprised. Ben and my mother know a good thing  when they see one, and you are definitely a good thing. ',
'I just... I don\'t know if I can get it done by labor day. There are still so  many bugs that I\'m going to have to work out. ',
'All you have to do is lay out in the sun, relax, put some of that lotion  on me, and I\'ll bet you it\'ll come to you. ',
'What, so we\'re not going to go to the beach today? ',
'I can buy you a beach if this thing sells. ',
'I don\'t want you to buy me a beach. I want to be with you. ',
'I know. I know. I\'m sorry. Look, I\'m going to make it up to you,  okay? I promise. I\'ve got to go. ',
'Why didn\'t you tell me that you were going to apply for this? ',
'Because I wanted it to be a surprise. ',
'Well, I think you really should have let me in on it, you know? ',
'Right. ',
'I mean, it\'s all set. ',
'I know. ',
'Wanting to honor my father, is that what you\'re saying is a  problem? I don\'t exactly call that a problem, Jesse. ',
'No, well, I mean, I\'m just been... ',
'Oh, I know what you meant. It\'s just I can only do one thing at a  time, you know, and it\'s just... It feels like you\'re pushing me. ',
'Well, is it me pushing or is it you pulling away? ',
'I\'m doing this because of you. ',
'Don\'t. ',
'Listen, I can\'t let you jeopardize your career because of me. ',
'David, I am a big girl. I make my own decisions, and I have  decided to stay with you. We can work this out together. We can clear your  name together. ',
'Vicky, don\'t you understand? I did what I thought I had to do, and  now I have to deal with it, okay? But I can\'t handle this if I have to worry  about you. ',
'I already have a lawyer. ',
'You can\'t use Ben Warren! You can\'t associate with a mob  attorney. What\'s that going to look like? ',
'Ben Warren is not a mob attorney. ',
'Oh, he\'s a known mob attorney, and you cannot use him! ',
'I\'ll get it. ',
'Well, speak of the devil. ',
'If you must. Yes? ',
'You know, counselor, I\'m really glad you\'re here. ',
'Yes? ',
'You\'re fired. ',
'Sweetie, now come on. Grandpa Alan is going to be fine. ',
'Grandpa\'s not coming home. He\'s never coming home, and I\'m  never going to get to see him again. ',
'No, no, of course you will. Lizzie, come on. It\'s going to be okay. ',
'He needs to know I miss him. He needs to know I love him. ',
'Sweetie, he does know that, now come on. He does. ',
'All right, maybe this wasn\'t such a good idea after all. ',
'Yeah, I think you\'re right. I really wanted to go back to the hospital,  but I think that Lizzie and I should just go home. ',
'The hospital\'s right across the street. ',
'I know. I know, honey, but Lizzie is very upset. ',
'Look, why don\'t I stay here with her, and while you two go. We\'ll  be fine. Won\'t we, Lizzie? We\'ll be fine. ',
'I... I... I don\'t... I don\'t... I don\'t know about that. I... I... ',
'No, no, Drew and Selena are both here, and besides, I think I need  to talk to her. ',
'Yeah, that\'s a good idea. We\'ll be in and out. Come on, let\'s go. ',
'Okay. Okay. Thank you, Susan. ',
'I will take very good care of this little girl. Lizzie, don\'t worry,  okay? ',
'Okay. Okay, sweetie, I\'ll see you in a few minutes. ',
'Thanks, Susie. ',
'No problem. Hey, you okay? ',
'I\'m not talking to you anymore. ',
'Why not? ',
'I thought you were my friend, Susan. But you\'re not. You\'re just  like the grown-ups. You won\'t let me see my grandpa. ',
'Lizzie. That was just an act. I\'m on your side. ',
'You are? ',
'Look, I\'m going to help you, Lizzie. Nobody\'s going to keep you  from seeing your grandfather. It\'s not fair. ',
'It\'s my fault, Susan. I did this to my grandpa. I hurt his heart. ',
'What are you talking about? ',
'I caused this by running away with Annie. Grandpa got so mad and  it was me, Susan. I didn\'t mean to, but I hurt his heart, and now he\'s going to  die. ',
'Look, Lizzie, you didn\'t do it, okay? Grown-ups have a lot of  problems that we don\'t know about, and sometimes they just wear out. ',
'I just wish I could talk to him, tell him how sorry I am, tell him  how much I want him to get better. ',
'You heard my mom. She said I can\'t go. ',
'Yes, I heard what she said, but maybe there\'s a way around it. ',
'What way? ',
'After they get in the car and leave, I\'m going to take you to the  hospital. I\'m going to let you in to see your grandfather. ',
'Do you mean that? ',
'Now you just can\'t tell anybody, okay? ',
'You\'re the best, Susan. ',
'You will not give up. I will not hear of it. You have too much to live  for. ',
'I\'m tired. So tired. ',
'Alan, of course you\'re tired. You just had a heart attack. You will be  up and at them in no time. ',
'I\'ve caused so much pain to the people I love because I was always  thinking of myself. ',
'Nobody\'s perfect, Alan. We all learn as we live our lives. Why  should you be any different? ',
'Because of the things I\'ve done. ',
'Nobody cares about those things now. Alan, your sons love you.  Lizzie is absolutely crazy about you. You\'ve got a brand-new grandson on his  way. ',
'I might never see him. ',
'You will see him. I know you will see him. Will you knock off the  self- pity? It doesn\'t look very good when you\'re attached to all these  machines. ',
'It\'s not self-pity. I\'m just being realistic. They say I\'m not going to  die. I think everybody\'d be better off if I did. ',
'Nobody will be better off if you did. ',
'Because I\'ve hurt Lizzie. I\'ve failed her. Caused Philip so much pain.  Now that I can... I can finally do what\'s right. ',
'No, no, Alan. No, stop saying that. Lizzie adores you. What would  that little girl do without you? Philip forgives you. He needs you. ',
'No, no he doesn\'t. ',
'Your son slept in a chair in the hallway because he didn\'t want to  leave your side last night. Now, if you ask me, that\'s a man who loves his  father. ',
'That\'s a man who should never forgive his father. ',
'By the time I showed , he already fixed the tractor, and cleaned up  the barn. ',
'You better be careful, you\'re going to work yourself out of a job. ',
'Still lots of work to do yet. ',
'Well, congratulations. I\'m glad it worked out. ',
'Me, too. But now I have to go take care of some things, so I\'ll see  you guys later. ',
'See you. So did you sleep in here? ',
'Slept in worse places. ',
'Well, I can tell you\'ve been working. ',
'Haven\'t even started yet. ',
'Looking for something? ',
'Wood screw. ',
'Very nice. Did you make this? ',
'Carved it. ',
'How long did it take you to do that? ',
'Two or three months. It\'s carved out of a single piece of wood. ',
'Mm-hmm. Where did you learn to do something like this? ',
'A long time ago. Granddaddy taught me. It\'s kind of a lost art.',
'Mm-hmm, where are you from? ',
'All over. ',
'What brings you here? ',
'Seemed as good a place as any. ',
'Well, how did you meet hart? ',
'You\'re just full of questions, aren\'t you? Is this an interview? ',
'I guess it comes naturally to me. I work for a paper. ',
'You a reporter? ',
'Uh-huh. I\'ve interviewed a lot of artists. You know, I could do a  story about you. ',
'Sorry. Not a chance. ',
'Kind of tough to swallow without milk. ',
'You think this is funny? ',
'Yes. If you have a problem, why don\'t you fill me in? ',
'She thinks that I should hire someone else, someone with a better  reputation. ',
'Yeah, David doesn\'t need a snake like you defending you. He\'s a  police officer who made a mistake, not a career criminal like Carmen Santos  or Annie Dutton. ',
'Wait, wait, wait, wait... Since when did Alan Spaulding\'s right  hand woman become so self-righteous? You\'re not exactly an altar girl  yourself. ',
'You\'re defending him over me? ',
'No, I\'m just trying to prove a point. ',
'Fine. You did. ',
'No, no, Vicky, come on, now wait a minute. ',
'Come on, Vicky, now... Come on, now. ',
'So, has anyone called Vicky? ',
'I haven\'t called anybody. ',
'I\'ll take care of it. ',
'Thanks, Beth. ',
'Let\'s grab a cup of coffee. There\'s a couple things I want to talk to  you about. ',
'All right. ',
'Looks like somebody else could use some coffee, too. Why don\'t you  make your phone calls, I\'ll go get some, all right? ',
'Yeah, mm-hmm. ',
'Hey, are you okay? ',
'I just... Jim, I wasn\'t expecting this. Alan and I have certainly never  gotten along, but Lizzie loves him and she\'s going to be heartbroken. ',
'Come on. Alan is a strong guy. He\'s going to pull through this. ',
'I know, I know, but I blamed him when Annie took Lizzie, and I  guess... I said a lot of things, and... Just, what if he doesn\'t pull through this? ',
'Come on, come on. You keep the faith. You make your phone calls,  I\'ll get some coffee, we\'ll go in and see him. All right? ',
'Okay. ',
'Okay. ',
'We have a few things to go over. ',
'Another time, Ben, okay? ',
'I\'m here now. ',
'Look, I\'m not exactly into this right now, all right? You know  what? Maybe Vicky\'s right. I mean, maybe... Maybe hiring you is making a  statement, right? ',
'If that statement is, \"I want to keep my tail out of jail.\" Now, I\'ve  been going over some of your former colleagues on the police force... ',
'I would downplay the anti-cop sentiment. Judges don\'t like it very  much. ',
'You know what? You think this is some kind of game, don\'t you? ',
'You want to win? If you want to win, you call me. But don\'t wait too  long. You have my number. ',
'Yeah, I\'ve got your number. I just hope you don\'t have mine. ',
'What? Alan had a heart attack? When? My God, is he okay? No,  no, no, I\'m coming right over. ',
'Well, well, well, well, well, well. This day keeps getting better. ',
'You know, I bet people would like to read about the work that goes  into something like this. ',
'Well, there are things you do that shouldn\'t be shared. Things you  need to keep to yourself. That\'s what makes them so special. ',
'Like what? ',
'Would you want someone writing about how you made love? ',
'Is wood-carving like making love? ',
'Is to me. ',
'How much do you want for the box? ',
'Sorry, not for sale. ',
'I thought this is how you earned your living? ',
'Sometimes. ',
'Well, I\'ll let you get back to your work. I\'ll see you again, I\'m sure. ',
'Here, I want you to have it. ',
'I couldn\'t accept it as a gift. Let me pay you for it. ',
'No, no, it\'s for what you said about me to Cassie. ',
'She hired you before I got here. ',
'That\'s not the point. You learn a lot from watching people when they  don\'t know you\'re there. ',
'I can\'t accept it. ',
'When someone offers you a kindness, the right thing to do is accept  it. ',
'I don\'t always do the right thing. But let me know if you want me to  do that story. (Telephone rings) ',
'So, you know, Max, just make sure that, you know, you can give  him a curfew if you want. He\'s pretty good on it, and just make sure you get  where he\'s going. ',
'Yeah, well, I\'m going to Los Angeles, mom, and I need... ',
'You came over here to get away from Jesse. ',
'What? ',
'Yeah. ',
'I... I really, I don\'t know what you\'re talking about. ',
'What I\'m talking about is if you have an issue about this wedding,  then you should talk to him about it. ',
'Issues... Right, well, I did. I did. We talked, and everything\'s fine.  He has a lot of good ideas. ',
'What about you? Ave ideas? ',
'Okay, okay, I\'m sorry. All right? Is there anything I can do? ',
'No. I talked to the rabbi, everything\'s fine. ',
'Did the rabbi say something about Jesse? ',
'No! ',
'Well, then what is it, Drew? Tell me, talk to me! ',
'Okay, calm down. ',
'Look, ever since you and Max and everybody\'s come into my life,  and I\'ve forgotten about my father. And this, this is a way for me to make it up  to him. ',
'I don\'t want to hold off on the wedding. ',
'Okay. ',
'It\'s just been emotional for me these past few days. I\'m sorry for  getting down on you. I don\'t mean it, there\'s no problem. ',
'Uh-huh. ',
'Hi. She\'s going to be a good sitter. Everything\'s clear. ',
'You know, I\'m really proud of you. ',
'Why? ',
'Well, you\'ve come a long way since the last time we went to L.A. A  year ago. ',
'Feels like a thousand years ago. ',
'Okay. ',
'Okay. ',
'Pilar? ',
'Hey. ',
'Hey. Are you still speaking to me? ',
'Of course I am. Sit down, please. What\'s up? ',
'Well, that\'s a good philosophy. I wish everyone felt the same way. I  mean, not only could I lose my job and wind up in jail, but Vicki just dumped  me. ',
'Ooh, I\'m sorry. ',
'Yeah. ',
'Somehow it doesn\'t seem right. ',
'You know, you\'re pretty amazing. I hope Bill realizes that he\'s a  lucky guy. ',
'Well, Bill\'s pretty busy these days, so... He\'s working a lot. ',
'Yeah? ',
'Yeah. ',
'Well, I hope he\'s not too busy this weekend. ',
'Especially this weekend. Why? ',
'Oh, thanks. That\'s really nice of you, but... I mean, I\'d really love to  go, but I\'m afraid Bill won\'t be available till the next millennium. ',
'No, I mean... It\'s not that. You know what? I don\'t see why not. ',
'No, no, no, come on, Pilar, it\'s really okay. I mean, I know I\'m  everyone\'s worst nightmare right now, so... ',
'No, you\'re not. You\'re not. You\'re not, really. Let\'s go. I mean, why  waste these great tickets anyway, right? ',
'Are you sure? ',
'Mm-hmm. ',
'You know what? You are so understanding, it\'s unbelievable. ',
'One minute I was just standing there with her, and then the next  minute, she was just gone, and I was looking everywhere for her, and... ',
'Is that your mother? ',
'Something like that. Thanks. Thank you. ',
'Susan, what are you doing here? ',
'Where\'s Lizzie? You were supposed to be watching Lizzie. Susan,  where is Lizzie? ',
'She\'s.... She\'s with Alan? ',
'Oh, Susan. ',
'You make it so hard to stay mad at you, you know that? ',
'Philip. You know, we can\'t let the press get a hold of this  information about Alan\'s heart attack. I mean, the stockholders are going to  run for cover. ',
'How\'s slum life with the \"Daily Mirror\"?  (Laughs)  Listen, I\'ve got  some news for you.  Alan Spaulding had a heart attack and it doesn\'t look  good.  No. ',
'When I heard what happened, it made me so scared. I thought I\'d  never see you again and that made me so sad. ',
'That would make me sad too, Elizabeth. ',
'I love you, grandpa. I don\'t want you to ever leave me. ',
'I promise I will never ever leave you. '

'Well, it doesn’t happen often for a drama …',
'Right.',
'…on Fox.',
'Now this is probably a dumb question, but you’ve seen the show.',

'That’s like saying, \"Would you rather work two days a week or would you rather work seven days a week?\"   (Pauses)  Well …',
'Now, would the show continue without you? Would they get another \"X-Filer” in there while you did the movie?',

'Now in the film, was it a lot of special effects, of not a lot of special effects?',
'There’s more special effects than we use in the TV show.',
'That makes it harder on the actor, doesn’t it?',
'And these are actual --',
'Actual bees.',
'Bzzz. Honey bees.',
'I don’t know. What you’ll see in the movie are mostly computer generated bees, because apparently real bees don’t look real …. enough.',

'Thank you. Would you like to try it on?',
'Oh, yeah. I’ll try it on, sure.  I hope it fits. (It is huge.) I hope I don’t look ridiculous.',
'Well, you know it folds up.',
'Oh, I didn’t realize you got to fold it up….',
'Fold it up. I don’t know how to fold it up.',
'I don’t want to… Does it fold up of -- does it wad up? Two completely different techniques there …',
'I wouldn’t know how to begin to answer that question.',
'Well, that’s sweet that they’re thinking of you though.',
'Isn’t it?',
'Yeah. Let’s show the folks a couple of seconds from the film.',
'Yeah, yeah.',
'Do you know what we’re going to see here?',
'This is you and your co-star, Gillian Anderson…',
'Gillian Anderson, right.',
'She was here a couple of weeks ago.',
'Yeah.',
'She’s nice.',
'Yeah, very nice.',
'Lovely woman.',
'Lovely woman.',
'Is she married, that woman?',
'No, she’s not.',
'Really? Attractive.',
'Yeah, I mean … you know, I can get her number for you if you want.',
'Really?',
'It wouldn’t kill you, would it?',
'Yeah.',
'Be a sport.',
'I will. I’m sporting.',
'Yeah. All right. See what happens.',
'Be like calling that newspaper in Louisiana.',
'We’re being chased by the bad guys.',
'Here you go, \"X-Files,\" opening Friday.',
'Yeah.',
'Talk to me, Scully!!!',
'There you go, there you go. Wow.',
'Let me just say that, I’m very proud of my acting in that clip.',
'You were doing some crouching. I thought that was first-class crouching.',
'Thank you. I thought I crouched beautifully.',
'Yeah. It wasn’t squatting; it was crouching.',
'All I can say is that is not representative of the film in any way.',
'It’s so hard to bring a clip that doesn’t give away too much, but that’s just an idea that … it’s bigger than the TV show.',
'What I like is it’s reminiscent of that scene from \"North by Northwest\" Hitchcock film.',
'Reminiscent is a kind word.',
'Yeah, and ….',
'Was it?',
'In the same location.',
'I didn’t know that.',
'I think pretty much the same deal, yeah.',
'Yeah, that’s very possible.',
'Yeah, yeah..',
'Yeah.',
'And are there other little things like that on the film?',
'I... I think there are, but I’m so ignorant that I don’t …',
'No, you’re not. Come on.',
'I don’t know…',
'Come on, put the hat on.  Put the hat on!  Here we go.',
'Hot diggity. You look fantastic.',
'Thank you.',
'Your hair is a little -- it\'s different, it\'s lighter in color.',
'I\'ve been out in the sun.',
'Hello! You look great -- you look like a kid for God\'s sakes. How have you been? Everything all right?',
'Yeah. That\'s funny coming out over there.',
'Well, we\'re just doing it different. That other entrance is closed now.',
'But you can\'t really get to YOU if you do that - that\'s what it\'s all about.',
'Just give me a call, I\'ll send these people home. You know, we\'re talking about -- jeez you look great.',
'Thank you.',
'We\'re talking about Thanksgiving.',
'(looks at Paul) You don\'t speak for this entire --',
'That\'s right - that\'s right.',
'I learned my lesson, I learned my lesson.',
'We\'re talking about Thanksgiving and what\'s a big star like you do on Thanksgiving? What\'s going on there?',
'I do the same thing every year really.',
'What is that?',
'I go to Oprah\'s and',
'I\'ll bet you\'ve been on Oprah half a dozen times haven\'t you?',
'Oh, closer to a dozen probably.',
'Really? I haven\'t been on once.',
'Why do you think that is?',
'Well, I think it\'s something about my personality that rubs Oprah the wrong way.',
'Like a loofah gone wrong.',
'(Laughing) Exactly, like a loofah gone wrong. Other than going to Oprah\'s, what do you do? What will you do for Thanksgiving?',
'I will give so much thanks this Thanksgiving. There\'s not enough hours in the day.',
'Well, I hope everybody does that, absolutely.',
'Me too',
'And you changed your hair. Am I nuts or you did change your hair a little bit.',
'No, I did change my hair. About 32 hours ago.',
'Oh really, so this is brand new.',
'I know you do.',
'And, you just seem nicer to the blondes.',
'Oh, now that\'s not true! That\'s not true.',
'Yeah.',
'You know you are my favourite, of course.',
'Thank you Dave, thank you.',
'You know that don\'t you?',
'Thank you. You know, he never forgets my birthday, it was just my birthday and you never forget my birthday and I love that about you.',
'Why would I forget your birthday?',
'Because it\'s one tiny day out of your entirely busy year.',
'You gotta take a shot.',
'Well, it was for you but then I kinda turned it, pretended to a director that it was for a movie.',
'Well, what is the film going to be?',
'A movie that I\'m doing with a director called Steven Soderbergh.',
'You\'ve worked with him in the past.',
'I have.',
'And can you tell us any more about that?',
'It\'s called \"Full Frontal.\" Need I say more?',
'Easy Paul.',
'(to Paul) You say nothing!! You say nothing. Do not speak.',
'You know, I went to see the Ocean\'s 11 movie and people have been talking about this like for years. You must have seen the original film, right?',
'I’ve seen part of it.',
'Well, the original film as you know, was exciting because of the cast.',
'And only because of the cast.',
'Yeah, but in many cases that\'s plenty. You know?',
'It\'s like a Tylenol PM.',
'But the reason everybody loved that movie is that cause all of these guys, Paul\'s buddies, The Rat Pack.',
'Who\'s buddy?',
'Paul.',
'Who?',
'Paul Shaffer.',
'Who?',
'Paul Shaffer\'s buddies.',
'Anyway ...',
'They were, they did the movie while they were all working.',
'That whole 23 hour a day schedule they were on.',
'Yeah, so now this movie has the equal star power to that movie and was the experience that you made the movie anything like the movie -- like the original?',
'Well we weren\'t, you know, drunk the entire time.',
'Oh come on, you must have been drunk the whole time.',
'Well, now, well, no not the entire time. Only during my scenes.',
'Wow. I want to tell you something and I\'m not making the jokes about this. I watched that movie and I can only take so much of George Clooney. Honest to God.',
'You and me both!',
'Thank you',
'We\'ll be right back with Julia Roberts everybody.',
'It\'s so nice to have you with us. Here\'s how dumb I am. I always thought you lived in California. Do you not live in California?',
'No, I\'ve never lived in California. I\'ve lived in New York City since I was 17 years old.',
'How come that I don\'t see more of you if you live here in New York City?',
'Dave, don\'t get me started.',
'What does that mean?',
'Please don\'t get me started.',
'Don\'t get you started cause it\'s something good or don\'t get you started cause it\'s something bad?',
'No because I\'ve invited you places.',
'Oh, that\'s not true, no, no, no',
'I\'m asking you not to go there and now your going, no, no, no, no.',
'Here\'s how I remember it. One time..',
'No, not the one time a thousand years ago, no, no, no. I\'ve invited you to a party and you said okay I\'ll be there and then, you, this is what he did.',
'Did I not come?',
'It was actually really good. No, it was really good because instead of just being a no show, you sent a case of champagne.',
'Come on, how about that? My God.',
'Sent a case of champagne saying, \"Thanks but I\'m not coming.\"',
'That\'s right. But you know why? I have that social anxiety disorder.',
'Then take some Paxil.',
'Is it because it\'s so cold in here you can\'t go anywhere that\'s like over 32 degrees Fahrenheit?',
'You make me sound like I\'m a gold miner. Out West.',
'I don\'t want to be too specific about where it is, you know, but it\'s in the west.',
'(singing) Happy trails to you. (The band joins in)',
'Is there anything you can tell us about what your place is like out there?',
'I do have a house in the Southwest which perfectly compliments my perfect life in New York City.',
'In the Northeast.',
'New York City; best place in the world.',
'And is it like a ranch?',
'Yeah, ranch-ish.',
'Ranch-ish? Do you have animals?',
'I do.',
'Like horses?',
'I have horses.',
'And do you have people taking care of the horses?',
'Yes.',
'Are they like cowboys and wranglers?',
'I tell you, they are kinda cowboys. My friends Mike and Marcus.',
'And when you go out there what is it like? Do you ride the horses?',
'I ride the horses, I play with the dogs.',
'What kind of dogs do you have?',
'All dogs from the pound.',
'Oh God bless you, that\'s great!',
'We have ten.',
'They\'re ranch dogs, they\'re running around all the time?',
'Yeah, they love it. It\'s great.',
'Do you get up bright and early, sunup, sunrise?',
'Sunup.',
'Do you have a big breakfast?',
'Oh you know, I love a big breakfast.',
'Oh, who doesn\'t?',
'Well .... somebody.',
'No, everybody loves a big breakfast.',
'Well, I love a big breakfast. I don\'t always get it but I love a big breakfast.',
'And then you go out riding and stuff?',
'No, not every morning. There are chores to be done and things to do and it\'s just kinda like regular life.',
'Now when you say chores to be done you mean yelling at the help?',
'No, you\'re confused, we\'re talking about my house, not your house.',
'There\'s no animosity. I think the world of you. I\'ve always thought the world of you.',
'But our relationship has just gone on too long.',
'What does that mean? It\'s no longer viable? You mean we\'re growing apart?',
'(laughter) Yeah.',
'Okay now, I want to show part of this movie.',
'Oh, I wish you would that\'s why I\'m here.',
'One?',
'I\'m here to .....',
'Two.',
'To give thanks these couple of days before Thanksgiving for my friend Dave Letterman.',
'Oh, that\'s very sweet of you, thank you. And I know you did something very nice last night, too.',
'Oh, yes, well that\'s not my third reason.',
'But that was something very nice.',
'It was very nice and it was very fun and I\'m so happy to be invited to that. Do you think we should let them in on it?',
'I think you should, sure.',
'It\'s a nice night for something really, really good. Paul\'s terrific, isn\'t he?',
'Yes he is.',
'All right, let\'s do the clip here now. I hope you\'re in this. Are you in this clip?',
'The clip I actually had picked I\'m not in, I thought it would be funny.',
'Oh yeah. That\'ll sell tickets.',
'But I caved to peer pressure and I\'m in this clip.',
'All right, it\'s fantastic. Oh, you know, you\'re married to – is -- what\'s his name, or seeing is --',
'My boyfriend in the movie is Andy Garcia, I think that\'s what you\'re trying to say.',
'That\'s exactly what I\'m trying to say. Wouldn\'t I be fantastic on Oprah?',
'How about that for an entrance? Isn\'t it great?',
'Some of my best acting.',
'Oh, you look lovely though, just lovely. Well listen, it\'s great to see you again.',
'Thank you.',
'And I hope you have a nice holiday.',
'Thank you.',
'And thank you for saying such nice things about the holiday, about New York City and about me, too, that was very sweet of you.',
'Well, I wish everybody, including Paul, a very, very happy Thanksgiving and let\'s all be thankful for being New Yorkers and being here.',
'Hi!',
'Because it was silly, it was kind of a mix up because I bent over to kiss your hand and as I bent over, you kissed my ear.',
'See how that happens? It\'s called chemistry.',
'Yeah, it was great!',
'Uh huh.',
'You look great. You always look great. You’re a lovely woman and you have a beautiful dress.',
'Oh thank you so much!',
'Tell us about this dress',
'Mary Adams, this dressmaker, made it for me out of all my aprons.',
'Is it made of aprons?',
'Yeah, and there\'s lots of rick-rack on it.',
'Is that rick-rack or bricka-brack?',
'Ricka-rack!',
'Uh huh.',
'But I was wondering, how old do you have to be when you stop wearing rick-rack Dave? I\'m 42.',
'No, you\'re fine, it looks lovely.',
'Really? It\'s not like an ’I’ve written a letter to daddy’ kind of a dress?',
'No, it looks good!',
'Thank you! Enough about me, let\'s talk about us!',
'All right, OK.',
'I know you made the announcement of becoming a father --',
'Oh yeah, yeah.',
'Took a lot of pressure off of me, as you know, but it\'s really great, we\'re really happy, aren\'t we?',
'Yes, yes.',
'I love it. People say I\'m starting to show, Ooooh! Oooooh! It kicked!',
'Well, OK, I would be late. So, what\'s new in your life? I know you lead a very active -- you have a big schedule -- what are you doing new?',
'Now, Mary’s Fish Camp is a restaurant?',
'Never been on eBay.',
'Iris Fleischmann is the name of the owl?',
'Now, do you have an actual relationship with the seller when you buy something on that eBay?',
'What had you bought that came --',
'Baby clothes!',
'Yeah, that\'s nice.',
'So we\'re gonna call her Happy now -- so it sticks!',
'Now, I know Halloween’s coming --',
'I can\'t wait!',
'Now that\'s what I thought.',
'Jack-o-lanterns!',
'Do you do a lot of stuff?',
'Now, what a minute.',
'Back up!',
'You’re actually in a group of men and women who make crafts?',
'Yeah, and I\'m the president. It’s called the Crafty Beavers.',
'I know. You said that. Now, how long have you been together?',
'It\'s been 3 weeks.',
'Who selected the name for it?',
'I did. It was tough, too. I didn\'t know what to go with --',
'Busy like a beaver.',
'And what about your baking? Do you still do the cupcakes and stuff?',
'Yeah, yeah.',
'You\'re a very busy woman.',
'Yeah... (referring to the running gag about her “pregnancy”) and now this! This is it! No more! Tie the tubes!',
'Poke?',
'Yeah, it\'s like a poke. So if you want a cupcake, it\'s $1.50, with poke $2.00 and it\'s just like a little--they\'re called pokes. Isn\'t it ugly?',
'Yeah, now the other thing is, you\'re in the Jack Black --',
'The number one movie.',
'It\'s a very funny movie.',
'It’s hilarious.',
'He’s a very entertaining guy, Jack Black.',
'Yeah, he is.',
'So let\'s show people -- tell them your part in the movie.',
'Now, what do you mean political reasons?',
'But we want to show the clip, but you say that your part was cut down in the movie?',
'A little bit. But the clip is my entire part in the movie. I think we have time.',
'Do you want to tell people what it is, what we\'re going to see?',
'This is my entire part in the number one, Jack Black movie.',
'Amy Sedaris in School of Rock.',
'Number one movie.',
'A lot of people are saying you actually steal the film.',
'Oh, who?',
'Now, uh, it\'s always great to see you.',
'I know, it\'s so good to see you!',
'And I hope you come back soon and enjoy the holidays. I guess the holidays are coming soon.',
'Yeah, they\'re right around the corner.',
'Well, enjoy those and give my best to the Crafty Beavers',
'Thank you very much.',
'Isn\'t that nice?',
'You can\'t beat Marines on leave. Thank you. Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, let me get this straight.',
'David, David, David.',
'You\'ve been on the air 30 years, you\'re down to your last week, five shows --',
'Right.',
'-- and you spend 20 minutes of that time talking to that guy about his cat!',
'That\'s right, and if you stay on another 20, you\'ll be talking to the cat!',
'And Clint, Clint, Clint, one night, one night, Clint, would it have killed you one night to wear a tie? I don\'t know.',
'They\'re booing you. They\'re booing you.',
'What is this, a Friars Roast you\'re doing all of a sudden? It\'s nice of you to come out here.',
'Thank you very much. I feel great.',
'Do you really?',
'I wasn\'t going to touch on that, but since you brought it up, that is scary too. That\'s scary.',
'Oh, sure it\'s scary.',
'Good Lord. A real fan.',
'I could give her directions to your house, Mr. Free Time.',
'You got it. Well, maybe I\'ll come out to New York and hang out with you a little bit.',
'Oh, yeah, please do.',
'Sure.',
'You know, that brings up an interesting point.',
'All right. What is that?',
'Let me get into this.',
'Okay.',
'It\'s boring, I know.',
'Sure.',
'All right. First of all, you\'re not passing away.',
'That\'s right.',
'You\'re still funny.',
'Thank you.',
'You\'re vibrant, you\'re charming, energetic, entertaining, a very nice guy.',
'Ed, Ed, pick up a pointer or two. I don\'t know what that means.',
'Now, you see, you caught me off guard because I thought, ah-oh, he\'s setting it up and you\'re gonna take swerve to the right and do a joke, and you didn\'t.',
'Yeah. Okay, so you\'re alive, you\'re healthy. You\'re a very entertaining man.',
'Energetic, vibrant, all of that, right.',
'You\'re not going to prison, like many of our top Hollywood stars.',
'That\'s true.',
'You\'re still gonna be in show business.',
'I hope so.',
'You\'re gonna be on television.',
'I hope so.',
'I have a show. You could be on my show.',
'That\'s true.',
'Can I ask you a question?',
'You could be a guest. You could be a guest host. Come to think of it, you can have the damn thing. Why not? Things ain\'t that great.',
'You\'re still pissed, huh?',
'Hey, hey.',
'Chomping at the bit there.',
'Look, about guesting on your show, do you pay what we do, same fee?',
'Yeah, I believe so.',
'Then forget it. I won\'t work for that kind of money.',
'You couldn\'t go straight through with it, could you? You couldn\'t go straight through with it.',
'And then what people want to know regarding Ed, and it\'s none of my business, but I hear this, and you saved your money, right?',
'There you go. So it\'s a happy ending for everybody.',
'There\'s 15 minutes there.',
'Authors would be coming in, you know, here\'s Mrs. Potty Klosnick to talk about 18 ways to make lasagna. I mean, you would go for anything.',
'We still use her.',
'Do you really?',
'Yeah.',
'You don\'t throw anything away. It\'s like a slaughter house; you don\'t throw anything; you use everything.',
'You keep everything you can.',
'So what else is new in your life? Did you just fly out here? Did you just get in town?',
'From the look on his face, he doesn\'t.',
'I was doing stand-up comedy.',
'I\'m still working on the tie part, but I know you\'ve got the gym socks. You\'ve still got the gym socks.',
'I could take him. This is turning into a nightmare. Come on. All right. Let\'s go. Come on.',
'You live by the sword; you die by the sword. So you met where?',
'We met at the Comedy Store. I was doing stand-up comedy there. This was like the mid or late 70\'s.',
'I guess a couple years before you started your show back east.',
'Yeah.',
'And Clint would --',
'I thought you were going to say something else.',
'No. It was a great car. It was a beautiful old -- no hub caps, no marks on it, but the thing was powerful and fast and nasty looking.',
'Exactly.',
'You can measure him if you want to.',
'I don\'t know what\'s the matter with me. And I\'ve got my back up against the wall, and he walks right up to me. And do you have any idea what you said to me?',
'No.',
'Oh, it was unbelievable. So I\'m standing right like this, and he comes up to me, and he says \"Where\'s the men\'s room, punk?\" I carried that with me.',
'I think those are the moments you treasure.',
'He\'s pissed. Now he\'s pissed.',
'What else do you want to talk about? Anything else?',
'Yes, it is.',
'Bland, bland.',
'Right in front of you?',
'What the hell is that? I don\'t know. Are people nuts? I\'ve never seen anything like that.',
'This lady, it must have been the first time.',
'No. She seemed like a seasoned traveler.',
'No. My dog is 40 now.',
'You talked about that dog a lot, Bob.',
'Yeah. Bob passed away.',
'I didn\'t know that. I\'m sorry.',
'Well, it\'s a long time ago. That\'s what happens with pets. They bring you a lot of joy and a lot of happiness while they\'re around.',
'Yes, they do.',
'Belgian airhead. I do remember that. But lovable.',
'That\'s a great story. We\'ll be right back. Stay where you are.',
'We are out of time. Tomorrow night, 11:30 on NBC from Columbus, Ohio, Bob Hope Special. Thanks for being here tonight, Bob. I appreciate it.',
'Happy to be here.',
'David --',
'Yes, sir.',
'Thank you much.',
'Thank you.',
'I\'ll come back and see you in New York.',
'Thank you for my career.',
'Clint, thanks for being here.',
'How are \'ya. How do you do. Hi, Jon. This is a great place.',
'You can have any of this stuff you want. Please have a seat.',
'Thank you very much. Hi. How are \'ya.',
'Even Howard stood.',
'Boy, oh, boy. I wanna tell \'ya, this is very nice. What do you want for the place?',
'Oh, let\'s see. That hurts. Oh, man.',
'I\'m telling you something, as nervous and concerned and anxiety ridden as you may be --',
'Yes, sir.',
'See \'ya in \'98, I would guess.',
'On the other hand, of course, I\'ll be over it by Sunday.',
'It is a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for coming by and joining us on the show.',
'Well, I\'ll tell you how you can help here. Let\'s say you decided to stop doing your show.',
'Yes.',
'I know there\'s plenty you\'d miss about doing the show.',
'Yes.',
'What have you heard about me stopping the show?',
'Nothing, it\'s nothing. It\'s just my uncle, Mr. Tisch, and I were having breakfast.',
'No.',
'Right.',
'And slam it again, sure.',
'Sure.',
'Sure.',
'Make wallpaper out of it.',
'It stinks.',
'It couldn\'t be enough that it\'s just like garbage. They have to supply the missing element.',
'It hurts, doesn\'t it?',
'Terrible thing.',
'I wish they\'d go home or something.',
'Hey, don\'t screw with me, all right, pal?',
'Well, you know what it was, I went out there, and we did the show, I did the show, and you\'re done with it, and you think, hey, I\'m done with it.',
'Right.',
'Is that a violation now?',
'Congratulations to you.',
'Yes, I\'ve come a long way.',
'A man who speaks out.',
'I feel much better.',
'We\'ve got to take a commercial break. We\'re coming back with more David Letterman right after this, please.',
'Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome back to the show. I\'m here with Dave Letterman. Exciting news. I\'m his new side kick. Hey, everybody.',
'Yes, sir.',
'Really?',
'Yes, sir.',
'Oh, man.',
'-- what has been the coolest thing that\'s happened to you while you\'ve done your show?',
'Well, you know, you\'d think being in show business, or as close to it as I\'ve come, you ought to have a lot of cool things happen to you.',
'Sure.',
'Really?',
'And Groucho and all the rest.',
'Right.',
'All right.',
'-- Paul Newman calls up and he says, \"Dave,\" he says, \"I\'m thinking about getting me a Volvo station wagon, and I\'m gonna stuff a Ford 302 V-8 engine into it.\"',
'Sure.',
'Right, the tank.',
'So intellectually I don\'t want a Volvo station wagon, but, of course, internally it\'s Paul Newman, I say, \"Yes, I\'d like one.\"',
'\"Bring it on.\"',
'\"Paul, let me have that Volvo station wagon.\"',
'Sure. Me too.',
'No, he\'s very concerned about the world economics.',
'Ouch.',
'I don\'t know. I can see that\'s very nice though.',
'A 400 horsepower Volvo station wagon.',
'But when Paul Newman offers you a puffer, I mean, you take it. You don\'t turn down Paul Newman.',
'You\'d be a fool to pass on the puffer.',
'Oh, knock off the bullshit.',
'All right. Look, if I\'m going to be sliding you my resume, I gotta butter you up.',
'Oh, I\'m so sorry.',
'Absolutely.',
'-- some videotape of my last morning show. I am not necessarily proud of this.',
'No?',
'I have not seen it. I cannot look at it. It troubles me to watch.',
'We can turn that around.',
'All right. Here we go. Let\'s take a look. The Morning Show, ladies and gentlemen.',
'Monday there\'s going to be a show here called -- it\'s called Las Vegas Gambit, and you\'re gonna be hearing a lot of these things.',
'That was very moving.',
'You know, I think I might have had a puffer on my hair. Anyway, I lived through it. I\'ve done pretty well since.',
'Very well.',
'And I know the same is in store for you.',
'Well, I really appreciate it, and I appreciate your coming by. It means so much to us.',
'Thank you very much. I enjoyed myself.',
'Welcome to the show.',
'Thank you!',
'You look wonderful.',
'Thank you.',
'Do me a favour and others and tell us a little bit about yourself. Where you\'re from and what your life was like growing up, that kind of thing.',
'Okay, well, um. I\'m from Los Angeles, but my dad\'s a cinematographer, so I went on location a lot as a kid. So I lived in a lot of different places.',
'All over the world?',
'All over the world. Um, we lived in the Seychelle Islands --',
'Wow. That\'s fairly exotic, huh?',
'It\'s very exotic.',
'Where exactly are the Seychelle Islands?',
'The Seychelle Islands are off the east coast of Africa.',
'Ah, yeah. It\'s beautiful.',
'It\'s beautiful. It\'s under a Socialistic Dictatorship, though. So it\'s kind of difficult, because people are listening to your phone conversations all the time.',
'Really?',
'Yeah.',
'How old were you when you were there?',
'Seven.',
'Seven years old.',
'Yeah. And, um, you know, things are scarce there. Because, you know, there\'s not a lot of stuff. Consumerism is not --',
'Right.',
'(Laughing) One was the second half of Gandhi and the other one was This is Spinal Tap, so --',
'Well, there you go.',
'That\'s all you need to run a socialist island. And did you like this, did you find it adventurous, or were you kind of --',
'But, he was only trying to help, though.',
'And when you were a kid, where else did you live?',
'Um, I lived on Yugoslavia. Um, in Yugoslavia.',
'Wow!',
'Yeah. They wake up at one in the afternoon. And like, [in a Yugoslavian accent] \"I wake up at one in the afternoon, and I drink Vodka...\"',
'Yeah, sounds like it could be a very pleasant way of life.',
'It could be, I mean, it just depends on how much you like Vodka.',
'Well sure! Well, who doesn\'t like Vodka?',
'Who doesn\'t really?',
'What about your schooling? How were you able to -- did you go to school every place you lived?',
'Yeah, I mean, we went to the American School in London when we were there. And then I went to like a progressive high school.',
'Now, what do you mean \"progressive high school\"? Is that a good thing?',
'Oh my God.',
'And were they worried for you? Did they make comments about you?',
'Well, they tried to get my parents to send me to a psychologist when I was in kindergarten.',
'Mm hmm, well that doesn\'t seem like a major psychological disorder.',
'Like, I was hungry. God forbid! So they were like, \"Um, Zooey takes food from her lunch, like at 10 a.m.\"',
'That would be a snack.',

'Well, different cities have different reactions. I love New York.  New York loves me. It\'s so sweet.',

'It\'s dangerous, it\'s very dangerous.',
'So I was running.',
'Sometimes adoration can be overdone.',
'Overdone, you know, in Central Park – of course you do. I\'m sorry.',
'That\'s all right.',
'You\'ve been here long.  So you can go, and there\'s a -- there\'s a -- oh, God, I\'m so sorry.',
'That\'s all right. Central Park --',
'There\'s a road --',
'A road, a road in the park',
'A cut-through, and there are places where the wall, the --',

'So I found a place that was in between medium high.',
'Oh, you climbed up the embankment?',
'Scaled it, yes, as they were like, really pulling my legs and shoes and things.',
'Really. People that -- you were trying to get away from people in the Park.',
'Yes, yes, and I must say that I was the only one able to get up there.',
'Well good for you. You\'re lucky to be alive.',
'Is that sort of near the Zoo?',
'There\'s a Zoo in Central Park. The Central Park Zoo is right there in --',
'I think that\'s where I ended. You\'re making fun of me.',
'Now, let\'s talk about -- I was telling people before you got here that you and I are pretty much the same age. How did you celebrate your 50th birthday?',
'Oh, so -- it hasn\'t happened, you know, like that.',
'When I explain -- I was -- okay, this is serious. This is, I mean, this is really true. The embankment was true. I was in the middle of serious production.',
'Shit. What is with him? What is it?',
'Production for your pay-per-view television special.',
'Yes, and have it -- um, trying to -- I have control -- I had control.',
'Gentlemen, I\'ll clear the courtroom. Please, let the witness finish.',
'I think it\'s much more interesting what they think happened.',
'So anyway, it\'s your 50th birthday; you want to do something nice; you want to call attention to it.',
'Not -- well, I don\'t like -- well, Farrah Fawcett 50. It\'s like part of my name.  Farrah Fawcett, 44, part of my name. Do they say \"David Letterman 50\"?',
'No. They don\'t even say David Letterman.',
'They do too.',
'Oh, do they really, in the park?',
'No, well, the Zoo, I saw it in the Zoo.',
'So, uh, so, OK, it\'s a long story.',
'All right. Let\'s come back to that. Let\'s come back to that.',
'You don\'t want me to finish?',
'No. We\'ll come back to that.',
'Wow, wow, that is -- that\'s unusual, yeah.',
'Yeah. He\'s going oh -- no, now, there\'s a story.',
'I wonder if that happens. I wonder in families if that happens that much. It probably doesn\'t happen much, do you think?',
'You were an art major in college.',
'Uh-huh.',
'And you wanted to do like painting with --',
'I wanted to paint with my body, in other words --',
'An abstract sort of thing.',
'And yet not.',
'And, well, I can\'t -- it\'s probably difficult to do portrait work that way, right?',
'Well, I have to tell you I did the most incredible gluteus maximus.',
'Your butt, you\'re talking about your ass, right?',
'I guess I am. No, it\'s so good. It\'s one of the best things I\'ve ever done.',
'Who owns the artwork now? Is it something you have now in your private collection or did somebody buy that piece of art?',
'No, it\'s mine.',
'That\'s good.',
'Right, exactly.',
'So if you lean up against it, you know, and then there\'s this and then there\'s this.',
'And you\'re completely nude when you do this.',
'No.',
'No, no, of course not.',
'Ouch.',
'Ouch is right. Take a ride in a convertible and call me in the morning.',
'Get a cab. Good night.',
'I have on paint, I have on paint, so I\'m not nude.',
'May we show the pictures?',
'12.',
'What was his response? Has he seen the pictures in the Playboy?',
'Yes, he has.',
'And what is his reaction to that?',
'\"Yo mom.\" No, no, no.',
'\"Yo mom. Yo mom.\"',
'No. He said, \"Dope, that\'s really dope.\" I said, \"Dope?\" But any -- I have to say that I wouldn\'t have done the 1995 layout without his permission.',
'He was all right with it then; he was comfortable with it as a young man?',
'Well, he grew up with me with – surrounded by lots of my artwork, which is predominantly the female body.',
'Right, so he\'s seen that sort of thing before.',
'Yes, and he understood when I explained it to him what I wanted to accomplish which was to prove --',
'I really thought I was looking out the window.',
'That\'s right.  It\'s your first time here.',
'This is mine. It\'s just water?',
'Yeah.',
'My God.',
'(Attempting to change the subject) Look how nice you look. That\'s a lovely picture. You look great there on camera.',
'No, I don\'t like the way I look.',
'What happened? What happened? Are you all right, Corky? Did you go down? One of our stage managers went down, hit the deck. Are you all right? Are you OK?',
'What happened? What\'s he doing?',
'Oh, you tripped on a cable.',
'I don\'t blame him.',
'Has that ever happened before?',
'Only on his honeymoon. I don\'t even know what that means.',
'Lots of firsts, lots of firsts.',
'Hang on a second now, Farrah. Let me see what we\'re doing here now. We have to take you down for x-rays? Are you gonna be all right?',
'But I want to finish my story.',
'All right. We\'re coming right back. We\'ll be right back with Farrah Fawcett, ladies and gentlemen.',
'Welcome back to Nightline. So what were we talking about, your artwork? I want to show some of these. How many times have you been in Playboy, by the way?',
'Right. You don\'t have the other cover?',
'Well, what other cover are you talking about? The other cover, meaning what?',
'No. There are two.',
'And here\'s TV Guide.',
'I had my clothes on.',
'And you\'re naked in TV Guide as well. Wow, look at Thursdays at 9:00.',
'No, stop, no.',
'Is this the cover you\'re talking about?',
'No, not that one. I don\'t like that one. That\'s the 1978. Hef won.',
'Right. Anyway, did we get all of the ones?',
'No.',
'If you have a second, what\'s the deal on this guy? What\'s happening there? Who is that guy? What is that all about?',
'\"Look at me. I\'m in my underpants.\"',
'No. What does that say?',
'I don\'t know. I just -- there you go.',
'I don\'t know.',
'Get into a 12-step program immediately.',
'See, there\'s another one.',
'This is the one. Let\'s look at some of these.',
'Two covers.',
'Two covers of this issue?',
'Yes, two different covers.',
'I see, and what is the other cover?',
'It\'s, uh, different.',
'It would be really funny if the other cover was identical.',
'Well, all right.',
'That would be silly, wouldn\'t it?',
'Farrah, let\'s just show some of these, if we can, because they\'re lovely. Actually, this is kinetic artwork.',
'It -- Kinet? Really? What do you mean?',
'Like in motion, the human form.',
'Oh, that\'s the other one.',
'Yeah, that\'s nice. Can we show that?',
'Yes, yes, because you get -- Yes, so it\'s the first time Playboy has ever done two covers, two different covers of the same --',
'There\'s one right there. We can\'t show that too long.',
'No, you can\'t see --',
'Otherwise there will be trouble in the control room.',
'It\'s bubble wrap.',
'It\'s bubble wrap. All right. But I want to show the one with the paint there, show you\'re actually --',
'What?',
'Now what have I done? I can\'t find it. We had them clipped earlier.',
'Because, you know, the thing is -- first of all it\'s my -- my --',
'There\'s a thing there. I just wondered something. Wow, hey, hello!',
'There are things in here that I\'ve never seen.',
'Well, yes, well, OK. The thing is I had on paint, so -- that\'s one that\'s more -- You could just cover that, cover that.',
'How long did it take you to get the paint off?',
'You know what, it took a long time, it took an hour, and there was only hot water, scalding, scalding, a little joke they played on me.',
'Oh, really?',
'Yeah.',
'Now, Farrah, on the pay-per-view special, is it an hour long?',
'It\'s 58 minutes.',
'58 minutes?',
'Okay, that\'s another first. It\'s another first.',
'No, I didn\'t know. I thought it was an hour, but I didn\'t realize it was 58.',
'The thing is that they have their regulations. I don\'t know why but --',
'I know, but what kind of things do you --',
'What do you mean you know? Because it\'s the first time --',
'What do you do on the show?',
'Because this is the first time that there\'s ever been a pay-per-view -- what\'s wrong?',
'Well, nothing.',
'Special that is a non-live event.',
'Are you taking calls? Are you taking calls on that show?',
'Not Mike Tyson, not a concert, but OK, am I taking calls?',
'Yeah, on the show?',
'I\'m not there.',
'Right, but you also do some painting on the show.',
'Yes, yes.',
'Okay, pay-per-view special on June 11th.',
'That\'s right.',
'Well, I hope it\'s a big success for you, and congratulations on a lovely life and a wonderful career.',
'Thank you, so good to see you, that’s so sweet.',
'That’s true, I feel that way.',
'Thank you. I mean, it’s a bright spot in my night when I watch you.',
'Oh you’re the one.',
'Ohhhh, not true.',
'See how I do that, put that little zing there.',
'Yeah, a little zing, nice way to go.',
'Did you see John Melloncamp backstage?',
'No I didn’t, but I know he’s here.',
'(Laughs) Yeah he is here.',
'He is here, and I wouldn’t want to lie to you, I didn’t see him. But I knew he was going to be here, and it’s his birthday today.',
'Yes I did know that, he’s 46 today I think.',
'He’s 47 I think today.',
'47.',
'I’m 46 next couple of weeks.',
'Good for you.',
'Yeah, the umm, yes. He used to be called Cougar yeah?',
'I made the mistake earlier of referring to him as Johnny Cougar, but he’s not Johnny Cougar, he’s John Melloncamp.',
'Yeah...',
'Please do, please do. Put a weasel in your name and see what happens.',
'(To crowd) Thank you, Thank you. I feel so good to be here, thank you. You know I had a dream last night.',
'Lets here what it is.',
'Now, what do you suppose -- is there meaning to that or is it just random neurons firing?',

'He’s worth billions this guy.',
'I think he’s very, very rich.',
'And every year he invites a group of people.',
'Can you imagine that, like 400 people, invites them --',
'From different walks of life.',
'Oh, I wouldn’t like that.',
'Like you know, whose gonna be there? They wouldn’t tell you who was going to be there --',

'I ain’t going on vacation with 400 strangers to be in Arts and crafts class, it ain’t gonna happen.',
'I know, I know, it was.',
'Now, did you have any reluctance about this at all because I imagine, once you’re in the boat, I’m guessing you can’t bail, you can’t get off.',
'That’s a great film, very entertaining... now did you make fast friends on the boat or did you get off thinking oh, what was that all about.',
'Babes? Lot of babes?',
'There were very interesting types there, and of course very fantastic women and men, yes, yes.',
